    brief: Get the IAM policy for a Cloud Run job.
    description: |
      This command gets the IAM policy for a job. If
      formatted as JSON, the output can be edited and used as a policy
      file for *set-iam-policy*. The output includes an "etag" field
      identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
      concurrent policy updates; see
      $ gcloud alpha run registries set-iam-policy for additional details.
