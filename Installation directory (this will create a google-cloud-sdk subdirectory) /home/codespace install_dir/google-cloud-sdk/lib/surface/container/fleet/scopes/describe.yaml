      First retrieve the ID of the scope using the command below. The output of this command
      lists all the fleet's members, with their unique IDs in the Names column:

        $ {parent_command} list

      Then describe it:

        $ {command} SCOPE_NAME

            Shows the cluster upgrade feature information for the current scope.

            To view the cluster upgrade feature information for ``SCOPE_NAME'', run:

            Shows the cluster upgrade feature information for the current scope as well as
            information for all other scopes linked in the same rollout sequence (provided that the
            caller has permission to view the upstream and downstream scopes that exist in other
            fleets). This displays cluster upgrade information for scopes in the current scope's
            rollout sequence in order of furthest upstream to downstream.

            To view the cluster upgrade feature information for the rollout sequence containing
            ``SCOPE_NAME'', run:

              $ {command} SCOPE_NAME --show-linked-cluster-upgrade
