    brief: Delete a membership.
    description: |
      This command deletes the Fleet Membership resource corresponding to the cluster.

      This command is intended to delete stale Fleet Membership resources as doing so on a fully
      registered cluster will skip uninstalling the Connect Agent and and orphan in-cluster
      resources and agent connections to Google. To completely unregister the cluster, consider
      using the command: `{parent_command} unregister`.
    examples: |
      First retrieve the ID of the membership using the command below. The output of this command
      lists all the fleet's members, with their unique IDs in the Names column:

        $ {parent_command} list

      Delete a membership from the active project's fleet:

        $ {command} MEMBERSHIP_NAME
