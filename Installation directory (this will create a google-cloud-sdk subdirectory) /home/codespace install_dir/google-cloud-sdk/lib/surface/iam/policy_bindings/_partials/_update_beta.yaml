          Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL)
          syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL
          are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.

          Example (Comparison):

              title: "Summary size limit"
              description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
              expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"

          Example (Equality):

              title: "Requestor is owner"
              description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
              expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"

          Example (Logic):

              title: "Public documents"
              description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
              expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"

          Example (Data Manipulation):

              title: "Notification string"
              description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
              expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"

          The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression
          are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service
          documentation for additional information.
