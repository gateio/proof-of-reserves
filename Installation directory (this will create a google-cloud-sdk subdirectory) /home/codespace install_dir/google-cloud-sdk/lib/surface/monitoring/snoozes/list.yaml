      To order your results first by the snooze's display name and then the end time:

        $ {command} --sort-by=display_name,interval.end_time

      To order your results in reverse order, you can add '~' in front of the field name:

        $ {command} --sort-by="~display_name"

      To return results with expired snoozes only:

        $ {command} --filter="interval.end_time<+PT1S"

      To return results whose display name contain the word 'cloud':

        $ {command} --filter="display_name:(cloud)"
