    brief: Get the details of a Security Health Analytics custom module.
    description: |
      Get the details of a Security Health Analytics custom module. It does not resolve INHERITED enablement states
      to ENABLED or DISABLED for modules created at ancestor levels. For example, if the module is enabled
      at the ancestor level, modules for all child resources will have the enablement state set to
      INHERITED. Use `gcloud scc custom-modules sha get-effective` to retrieve a custom module with its effective enablement state.
