    description: |
      Revert a Filestore instance to the target snapshot.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The target snapshot does not exist.
        * The active account does not have permission to revert the instance.
        * The service tier of the instance does not support the operation.

      ``us-central1'' to the target snapshot named ``my-snapshot'' , run:

        $ {command} my-instance --target-snapshot=my-snapshot --location=us-central1
