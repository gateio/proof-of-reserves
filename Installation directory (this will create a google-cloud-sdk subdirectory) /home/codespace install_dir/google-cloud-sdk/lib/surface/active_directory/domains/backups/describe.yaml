      Show metadata for a Managed Microsoft AD domain backup.

      Displays all metadata associated with an Active Directory domain backup when provided with a
      valid domain backup name.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * The specified domain backup doesn't exist.
        * The active account doesn't have permission to access the specified
          domain.
    examples: |
      To display all metadata associated with an AD domain backup with the name
      `my-backup` under the domain `my-domain` in project `my-project`, run:

        $ {command} projects/my-proj/locations/global/domains/my-domain.com/backups/my-backup
