    *{command}* exports the configuration for a Compute Engine address.

    Address configurations can be exported in
    Kubernetes Resource Model (krm) or Terraform HCL formats. The
    default format is `krm`.

    Specifying `--all` allows you to export the configurations for all
    addresses within the project.

    Specifying `--path` allows you to export the configuration(s) to
    a local directory.
  examples: |
    To export the configuration for an address, run:

      $ {command} my-address

    To export the configuration for an address to a file, run:

      $ {command} my-address --path=/path/to/dir/

    To export the configuration for an address in Terraform
    HCL format, run:

      $ {command} my-address --resource-format=terraform

    To export the configurations for all addresses within a
