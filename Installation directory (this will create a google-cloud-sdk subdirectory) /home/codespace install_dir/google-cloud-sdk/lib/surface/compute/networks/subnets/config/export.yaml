    *{command}* exports the configuration for a Compute Engine subnetwork.

    Subnetwork configurations can be exported in
    Kubernetes Resource Model (krm) or Terraform HCL formats. The
    default format is `krm`.

    Specifying `--all` allows you to export the configurations for all
    subnetworks within the project.

    Specifying `--path` allows you to export the configuration(s) to
    a local directory.
