    brief: List Network Connectivity Center locations.
    description: |
      Retrieve and display a list of locations.

      Network Connectivity Center includes two general types of spokes: those
      that use the site-to-site data transfer feature and those that don't. To
      get a list of the locations that support one of these features, use the
      --filter flag (see examples). The full list of location features can be found here:
      https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/reference/networkconnectivity/rest/Shared.Types/LocationFeature

      To specify the maximum number of locations to return, use the `--limit` flag.

    examples: |
      To list all locations, run:

        $ {command}

      To list locations that support the site-to-site data transfer feature, run:

        $ {command} --filter="metadata.locationFeatures=SITE_TO_SITE_SPOKES"
