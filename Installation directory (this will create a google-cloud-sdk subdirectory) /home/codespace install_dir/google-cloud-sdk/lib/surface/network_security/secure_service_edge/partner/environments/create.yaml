  brief: |
    Create a partner SSE environment.
  description: |
    Create a new partner environment for customer realms.
  examples: |
    The following command creates a new partner environment named `my-environment` under the SSE provider `my-service`.

      $ {command} my-environment --security-service=my-service --symantec-api-endpoint=partner.com --partner-network=my-network --partner-facing-subnet-ranges=100.64.1.0/24,100.64.2.0/24

    Google will send customer traffic to `my-network` for security processing and use the `partner.com` endpoint to access the Symantec API.
