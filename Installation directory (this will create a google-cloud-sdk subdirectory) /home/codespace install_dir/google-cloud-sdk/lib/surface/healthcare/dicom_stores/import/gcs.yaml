    brief:  Import DICOM objects into a Cloud Healthcare API DICOM store.
    description: Import DICOM objects into a Cloud Healthcare API DICOM store.
    examples: |
      To import the DICOM objects from the existing bucket 'testGcsBucket' in the folder 'someFolder' into the DICOM store 'test-dicom-store', run:

        $ {command} test-dicom-store --gcs-uri="gs://testGcsBucket/someFolder/*" --dataset=test-dataset

      Note that '*' matches any files within a folder, and '**' also recursively matches files within sub-folders.

        Google Cloud Storage URI containing DICOM object data. It must match
        individual DICOM files or use wildcards to import multiple files
        from one or more directories.
        * Use * to match 0 or more non-separator characters. For example,
          `gs://BUCKET/DIRECTORY/Example*.dcm` matches Example.dcm and
          Example22.dcm in DIRECTORY.
        * Use ** to match 0 or more characters (including separators). Must
          be used at the end of a path and with no other wildcards in the path.
          Can also be used with a filename extension (such as .dcm), which
          imports all files with the filename extension in the specified
          directory and its subdirectories. For example,
          gs://BUCKET/DIRECTORY/**.dcm imports all files with the .dcm
          filename extension in DIRECTORY and its subdirectories.
        * Use ? to match 1 character. For example,
          gs://BUCKET/DIRECTORY/Example?.dcm matches Example1.dcm but
          does not match Example.dcm or Example01.dcm.
