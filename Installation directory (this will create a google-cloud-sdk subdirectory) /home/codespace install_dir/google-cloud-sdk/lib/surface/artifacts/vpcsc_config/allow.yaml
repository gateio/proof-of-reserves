    description: |
      Allow Artifact Registry remote repositories inside a service perimeter to retrieve data from their upstream sources outside of the perimeter.

      This command can fail for the following reasons:
        * Lack of permission - "accesscontextmanager.policies.update".
        * The resource could be outside of the VPC SC perimeter.
        * Lack of permission - "artifactregistry.vpcscconfigs.update"

    examples: |
      The following command allows remote repositories in the project my-project and in the region us--west1 to retrieve data from upstream sources outside the perimeter:

         $ {command} --project=my-project --location=us-west1

  arguments:
    resource:
      spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.artifacts.resources:location
      is_positional: false
