    brief: Sets the IAM policy for a workbench instance.

    description: |
      *{command}* sets the IAM policy for a Notebook instance given an
      instance ID and a JSON or YAML file that describes the IAM policy.

      Note: Setting the IAM policy for an Instance replaces existing IAM bindings for
      that account.

    examples: |
      The following command reads an IAM policy defined in the JSON file
      `policy.json` and sets it for Instance ID *my_instance* at the
      specified location:

        $ {command} my_instance --location=us-central1-a policy.json

      See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies for policy file
      format and content details.
