    brief: Creates a Parallelstore instance
    description: |
      Creates a Parallelstore instance.
    examples: |-
      To create an instance `my-instance` in location `us-central1-a` with 12000 Gib capacity run:

      $ {command} my-instance --capacity-gib=12000 --location=us-central1-a

        Identifier. The resource name of the instance, in the format

      required: false

        The description of the instance. 2048 characters or less.

      help_text: |-
        Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud
        resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and
        deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of
        resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
        And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
        firewall, load balancing, etc.).

         * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
           the following regular expression: `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}`.
         * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
           to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
         * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.

        See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.

        If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
        characters may be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use
        an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
        specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
        as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
        allow "_" in a future release.
