    brief: Import an EdgeCacheKeyset resource.
    description: |
      Import an EdgeCacheKeyset resource. If the named EdgeCacheKeyset
      resource already exists, the resource will be updated to match
      the imported resource configuration.

      Note: If you are updating an existing EdgeCacheKeyset resource,
      you should ensure that it includes any public keys still needed
      to validate incoming user requests.

      If the named EdgeCacheKeyset resource does not already exist, a
      new EdgeCacheKeyset resource will be created with that name.

    examples: |
      To import an EdgeCacheKeyset resource named 'my-keyset' from a
      YAML file, run:

        $ {command} my-keyset --source=my-keyset.yaml
