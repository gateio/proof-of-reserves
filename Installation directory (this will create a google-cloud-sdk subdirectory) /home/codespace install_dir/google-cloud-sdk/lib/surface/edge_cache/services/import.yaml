    brief: Import an EdgeCacheService resource.
    description: |
      Import an EdgeCacheService resource. If the named
      EdgeCacheService resource already exists, the resource will be
      updated to match the imported resource configuration.

      If the named EdgeCacheService resource does not already exist, a
      new EdgeCacheService resource will be created with that name.

    examples: |
      To import an EdgeCacheService resource named 'my-service' from a
      YAML file, run:

        $ {command} my-service --source=my-service.yaml
