  brief: Get the IAM policy for the database.
  description: |
    `{command}` displays the IAM policy associated with the database.
    If formatted as JSON, the output can be edited and used as a
    policy file for set-iam-policy. The output includes an "etag" field
    identifying the version emitted and allowing detection of
    concurrent policy updates. The "etag" field should be removed to be
    used as set-iam-policy input; see `{parent_command} set-iam-policy`
    for additional details.

    To print the IAM policy for a given database, run:
