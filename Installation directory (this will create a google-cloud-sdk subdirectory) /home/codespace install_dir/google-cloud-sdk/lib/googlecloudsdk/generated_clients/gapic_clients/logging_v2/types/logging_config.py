            For example: projects/my_project/sinks/SINK_NAME
        destination (str):
            Required. The export destination:

            ::

                "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"
                "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]"
                "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
                "logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]"
                "logging.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]"

            The sink's ``writer_identity``, set when the sink is
            created, must have permission to write to the destination or
            else the log entries are not exported. For more information,
            see `Exporting Logs with
            Sinks <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs>`__.
        filter (str):
            Optional. An `advanced logs
            filter <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced-queries>`__.
            The only exported log entries are those that are in the
            resource owning the sink and that match the filter.

            For example:

            ``logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR``
        description (str):
            Optional. A description of this sink.

            The maximum length of the description is 8000
            characters.
        disabled (bool):
            Optional. If set to true, then this sink is
            disabled and it does not export any log entries.
        exclusions (MutableSequence[googlecloudsdk.generated_clients.gapic_clients.logging_v2.types.LogExclusion]):
            Optional. Log entries that match any of these exclusion
            filters will not be exported.

            If a log entry is matched by both ``filter`` and one of
            ``exclusion_filters`` it will not be exported.
        output_version_format (googlecloudsdk.generated_clients.gapic_clients.logging_v2.types.LogSink.VersionFormat):
            Deprecated. This field is unused.
        writer_identity (str):
            Output only. An IAM identity-a service account or
            group-under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log
            entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set
            by specifying ``custom_writer_identity`` or set
            automatically by
            [sinks.create][google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.CreateSink]
            and
            [sinks.update][google.logging.v2.ConfigServiceV2.UpdateSink]
            based on the value of ``unique_writer_identity`` in those
            methods.

            Until you grant this identity write-access to the
            destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For
            more information, see `Granting Access for a
            Resource <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource>`__.
            Consult the destination service's documentation to determine
            the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.

            Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the
            same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and
            no additional permissions are required.
        include_children (bool):
            Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by
            organizations and folders. If the field is false, the
            default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource
            are available for export. If the field is true, then log
            entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts
            contained in the sink's parent resource are also available
            for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children
            is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.

            For example, if this field is true, then the filter
            ``resource.type=gce_instance`` would export all Compute
            Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the
            sink's parent.

            To only export entries from certain child projects, filter
            on the project part of the log name:

            logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR
            "projects/test-project2/") AND resource.type=gce_instance
        intercept_children (bool):
            Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by
            organizations and folders.

            When the value of 'intercept_children' is true, the
            following restrictions apply:

            -  The sink must have the ``include_children`` flag set to
               true.
            -  The sink destination must be a Cloud project.

            Also, the following behaviors apply:

            -  Any logs matched by the sink won't be included by
               non-\ ``_Required`` sinks owned by child resources.
            -  The sink appears in the results of a ``ListSinks`` call
               from a child resource if the value of the ``filter``
               field in its request is either ``'in_scope("ALL")'`` or
               ``'in_scope("ANCESTOR")'``.
        bigquery_options (googlecloudsdk.generated_clients.gapic_clients.logging_v2.types.BigQueryOptions):
            Optional. Options that affect sinks exporting
            data to BigQuery.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``options``.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The creation timestamp of the
            sink.
            This field may not be present for older sinks.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last update timestamp of the

            effect of this field on the value of ``writer_identity`` in

               ``writer_identity`` is changed to a `service
               agent <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-types#service-agents>`__
               owned by Cloud Logging.
            -  It is an error if the old value is true and the new value
               is set to false or defaulted to false.
        custom_writer_identity (str):
            Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will
            be used to write the log entries. The format must be
            ``serviceAccount:some@email``. This field can only be
            specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside

            only fields cannot be updated.

            An empty ``updateMask`` is temporarily treated as using the

            At some point in the future, behavior will be removed and
