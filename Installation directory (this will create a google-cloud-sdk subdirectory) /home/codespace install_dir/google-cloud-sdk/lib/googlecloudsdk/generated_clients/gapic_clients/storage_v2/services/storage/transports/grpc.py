    API Overview and Naming Syntax
    ------------------------------

    The Cloud Storage gRPC API allows applications to read and write
    data through the abstractions of buckets and objects. For a
    description of these abstractions please see
    https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs.

    Resources are named as follows:

    -  Projects are referred to as they are defined by the Resource
       Manager API, using strings like ``projects/123456`` or
       ``projects/my-string-id``.

    -  Buckets are named using string names of the form:
       ``projects/{project}/buckets/{bucket}`` For globally unique
       buckets, ``_`` may be substituted for the project.

    -  Objects are uniquely identified by their name along with the name
       of the bucket they belong to, as separate strings in this API.
       For example:

       ReadObjectRequest { bucket: 'projects/_/buckets/my-bucket'
       object: 'my-object' } Note that object names can contain ``/``
       characters, which are treated as any other character (no special
       directory semantics).

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.

                authorization credentials to attach to requests. These

                are specified, the client will attempt to ascertain the

            api_mtls_endpoint (Optional[str]): Deprecated. The mutual TLS endpoint.

                A callback to provide client certificate bytes and private key bytes,

                The client info used to send a user-agent string along with
                API requests. If ``None``, then default info will be used.
                Generally, you only need to set this if you're developing
                your own client library.

                be used for service account credentials.

        r"""Return a callable for the write object method over gRPC.

        Stores a new object and metadata.

        An object can be written either in a single message stream or in
        a resumable sequence of message streams. To write using a single
        stream, the client should include in the first message of the
        stream an ``WriteObjectSpec`` describing the destination bucket,
        object, and any preconditions. Additionally, the final message
        must set 'finish_write' to true, or else it is an error.

        For a resumable write, the client should instead call
        ``StartResumableWrite()``, populating a ``WriteObjectSpec`` into
        that request. They should then attach the returned ``upload_id``
        to the first message of each following call to ``WriteObject``.
        If the stream is closed before finishing the upload (either
        explicitly by the client or due to a network error or an error
        response from the server), the client should do as follows:

        -  Check the result Status of the stream, to determine if
           writing can be resumed on this stream or must be restarted
           from scratch (by calling ``StartResumableWrite()``). The
           resumable errors are DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, INTERNAL, and
           UNAVAILABLE. For each case, the client should use binary
           exponential backoff before retrying. Additionally, writes can
           be resumed after RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED errors, but only after
           taking appropriate measures, which may include reducing
           aggregate send rate across clients and/or requesting a quota
           increase for your project.
        -  If the call to ``WriteObject`` returns ``ABORTED``, that
           indicates concurrent attempts to update the resumable write,
           caused either by multiple racing clients or by a single
           client where the previous request was timed out on the client
           side but nonetheless reached the server. In this case the
           client should take steps to prevent further concurrent writes
           (e.g., increase the timeouts, stop using more than one
           process to perform the upload, etc.), and then should follow
           the steps below for resuming the upload.
        -  For resumable errors, the client should call
           ``QueryWriteStatus()`` and then continue writing from the
           returned ``persisted_size``. This may be less than the amount
           of data the client previously sent. Note also that it is
           acceptable to send data starting at an offset earlier than
           the returned ``persisted_size``; in this case, the service
           will skip data at offsets that were already persisted
           (without checking that it matches the previously written
           data), and write only the data starting from the persisted
           offset. Even though the data isn't written, it may still
           incur a performance cost over resuming at the correct write
           offset. This behavior can make client-side handling simpler
           in some cases.
        -  Clients must only send data that is a multiple of 256 KiB per
           message, unless the object is being finished with
           ``finish_write`` set to ``true``.

        The service will not view the object as complete until the
        client has sent a ``WriteObjectRequest`` with ``finish_write``
        set to ``true``. Sending any requests on a stream after sending
        a request with ``finish_write`` set to ``true`` will cause an
        error. The client **should** check the response it receives to
        determine how much data the service was able to commit and
        whether the service views the object as complete.

        Attempting to resume an already finalized object will result in
        an OK status, with a WriteObjectResponse containing the
        finalized object's metadata.

        Alternatively, the BidiWriteObject operation may be used to
        write an object with controls over flushing and the ability to
        fetch the ability to determine the current persisted size.
