class Access(_messages.Message):
  r"""Represents an access event.

  Fields:
    callerIp: Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
    callerIpGeo: The caller IP's geolocation, which identifies where the call
      came from.
    methodName: The method that the service account called, e.g.
      "SetIamPolicy".
    principalEmail: Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email
      address of the authenticated user or a service account acting on behalf
      of a third party principal making the request. For third party identity
      callers, the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this
      field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes
      redacted. For more information, see [Caller identities in audit
      logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
    principalSubject: A string that represents the principal_subject that is
      associated with the identity. Unlike `principal_email`,
      `principal_subject` supports principals that aren't associated with
      email addresses, such as third party principals. For most identities,
      the format is `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool
      name}/subject/{subject}`. Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD,
      FREEFORM, and GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD, still use the legacy format
      `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`.
    serviceAccountDelegationInfo: The identity delegation history of an
      authenticated service account that made the request. The
      `serviceAccountDelegationInfo[]` object contains information about the
      real authorities that try to access Google Cloud resources by delegating
      on a service account. When multiple authorities are present, they are
      guaranteed to be sorted based on the original ordering of the identity
      delegation events.
    serviceAccountKeyName: The name of the service account key that was used
      to create or exchange credentials when authenticating the service
      account that made the request. This is a scheme-less URI full resource
      name. For example: "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAc
      counts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}".
    serviceName: This is the API service that the service account made a call
      to, e.g. "iam.googleapis.com"
    userAgent: The caller's user agent string associated with the finding.
    userAgentFamily: Type of user agent associated with the finding. For
      example, an operating system shell or an embedded or standalone
      application.
    userName: A string that represents a username. The username provided
      depends on the type of the finding and is likely not an IAM principal.
      For example, this can be a system username if the finding is related to
      a virtual machine, or it can be an application login username.

    Values:

        doesn't write a severity value.
      CRITICAL: Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable
        by an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
        to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
        additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
        Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and public
        SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a threat that
        is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
        within existing resources.
      HIGH: Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
        and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to
        gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
        exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges
        to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak
        or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database
        could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the
        internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create
        new computational resources in an environment but not able to access
        data or execute code in existing resources.
      MEDIUM: Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
        actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to
        eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access
        and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An
        example is a service account with access to more projects than it
        should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they
        could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service
        account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able
        to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute
        unauthorized code.
      LOW: Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
        organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in
        their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security
        issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource
        configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has
        obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able to access
        data, execute code, or create resources.

  r"""Represents an access event.

  Fields:
    callerIp: Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
    callerIpGeo: The caller IP's geolocation, which identifies where the call
      came from.
    methodName: The method that the service account called, e.g.
      "SetIamPolicy".
    principalEmail: Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email
      address of the authenticated user or a service account acting on behalf
      of a third party principal making the request. For third party identity
      callers, the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this
      field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes
      redacted. For more information, see [Caller identities in audit
      logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
    principalSubject: A string that represents the principal_subject that is
      associated with the identity. Unlike `principal_email`,
      `principal_subject` supports principals that aren't associated with
      email addresses, such as third party principals. For most identities,
      the format is `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool
      name}/subject/{subject}`. Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD,
      FREEFORM, and GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD, still use the legacy format
      `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`.
    serviceAccountDelegationInfo: The identity delegation history of an
      authenticated service account that made the request. The
      `serviceAccountDelegationInfo[]` object contains information about the
      real authorities that try to access Google Cloud resources by delegating
      on a service account. When multiple authorities are present, they are
      guaranteed to be sorted based on the original ordering of the identity
      delegation events.
    serviceAccountKeyName: The name of the service account key that was used
      to create or exchange credentials when authenticating the service
      account that made the request. This is a scheme-less URI full resource
      name. For example: "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAc
      counts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}".
    serviceName: This is the API service that the service account made a call
      to, e.g. "iam.googleapis.com"
    userAgent: The caller's user agent string associated with the finding.
    userAgentFamily: Type of user agent associated with the finding. For
      example, an operating system shell or an embedded or standalone
      application.
    userName: A string that represents a username. The username provided
      depends on the type of the finding and is likely not an IAM principal.
      For example, this can be a system username if the finding is related to
      a virtual machine, or it can be an application login username.

    r"""The severity of the finding. This field is managed by the source that
    writes the finding.

    Values:
      SEVERITY_UNSPECIFIED: This value is used for findings when a source
        doesn't write a severity value.
      CRITICAL: Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable
        by an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
        to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
        additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
        Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and public
        SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a threat that
        is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
        within existing resources.
      HIGH: Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
        and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to
        gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
        exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges
        to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak
        or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database
        could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the
        internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create
        new computational resources in an environment but not able to access
        data or execute code in existing resources.
      MEDIUM: Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
        actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to
        eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access
        and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An
        example is a service account with access to more projects than it
        should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they
        could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service
        account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able
        to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute
        unauthorized code.
      LOW: Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
        organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in
        their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security
        issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource
        configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has
        obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able to access
        data, execute code, or create resources.
