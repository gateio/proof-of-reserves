    updateTime: Output only. The timestamp when the resource was updated.
    workloadContextSelectors: Optional. Selects the workload where the policy
      should be applied to its targets. A policy without a
      WorkloadContextSelector should always be applied to its targets when
      there is no conflict. If there are multiple WorkloadContextSelectors
      then the policy will be applied to all targets if ANY of the
      WorkloadContextSelectors match. Therefore these selectors can be
      combined in an OR fashion. If there are multiple ClientTlsPolicy
      targeted to the same BackendService, There should be only one effective
      ClientTlsPolicy and the precdence is as following: 1) ClientTlsPolicy
      with workload_context_selectors will take precedence first. 2) If there
      are multiple ClientTlsPolicy with workload_context_selectors matched,
      earliest created one will take take precedence. 3) Then ClientTlsPolicy
      without workloadSelector will take precedence. Right now we don't allow
      multiple ClientTlsPolicy without workloadSelector attached the same
      backendService. NOTE: For GSM use only.

    operationId: Identity of the operation. This must be unique within the
      scope of the service that generated the operation. If the service calls
      Check() and Report() on the same operation, the two calls should carry
      the same id. UUID version 4 is recommended, though not required. In

  can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to
  be contiguous-there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.

      missing child spans.
    displayName: A description of the span's operation (up to 128 bytes).
      Stackdriver Trace displays the description in the Google Cloud Platform
      Console. For example, the display name can be a qualified method name or
      a file name and a line number where the operation is called. A best
      practice is to use the same display name within an application and at
      the same call point. This makes it easier to correlate spans in
      different traces.
    endTime: The end time of the span. On the client side, this is the time
      kept by the local machine where the span execution ends. On the server
      side, this is the time when the server application handler stops
      running.
    name: The resource name of the span in the following format:
      projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/SPAN_ID is a unique
      identifier for a trace within a project; it is a 32-character
      hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array. [SPAN_ID] is a unique
      identifier for a span within a trace; it is a 16-character hexadecimal
      encoding of an 8-byte array.
    parentSpanId: The [SPAN_ID] of this span's parent span. If this is a root

    sameProcessAsParentSpan: (Optional) Set this parameter to indicate whether
      this span is in the same process as its parent. If you do not set this
      parameter, Stackdriver Trace is unable to take advantage of this helpful
      information.
    spanId: The [SPAN_ID] portion of the span's resource name.
    spanKind: Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context.
      For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using
      `CLIENT` (caller) and `SERVER` (callee) to identify an RPC call.
    startTime: The start time of the span. On the client side, this is the
      time kept by the local machine where the span execution starts. On the

class GoogleIamV1Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":

  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  Fields:
    allowOpen: This field applies only for Traffic Director policies. It is

      Determines if server allows plaintext connections. If set to true,
      server allows plain text connections. By default, it is set to false.
      This setting is not exclusive of other encryption modes. For example, if
      `allow_open` and `mtls_policy` are set, server allows both plain text
      and mTLS connections. See documentation of other encryption modes to
      confirm compatibility. Consider using it if you wish to upgrade in place
      your deployment to TLS while having mixed TLS and non-TLS traffic
