      that have the same metric names and identical label value combinations.
      If a request has such duplicated MetricValue instances, the entire
      request is rejected with an invalid argument error.
    operationId: Identity of the operation. This must be unique within the
      scope of the service that generated the operation. If the service calls
      Check() and Report() on the same operation, the two calls should carry
      the same id. UUID version 4 is recommended, though not required. In

  can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to
  be contiguous-there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace. This

      missing child spans.
    displayName: A description of the span's operation (up to 128 bytes).
      Stackdriver Trace displays the description in the Google Cloud Platform
      Console. For example, the display name can be a qualified method name or
      a file name and a line number where the operation is called. A best
      practice is to use the same display name within an application and at
      the same call point. This makes it easier to correlate spans in
      different traces.
    endTime: The end time of the span. On the client side, this is the time
      kept by the local machine where the span execution ends. On the server
      side, this is the time when the server application handler stops
      running.
    name: The resource name of the span in the following format:
      projects/[PROJECT_ID]/traces/[TRACE_ID]/spans/SPAN_ID is a unique
      identifier for a trace within a project; it is a 32-character
      hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array. [SPAN_ID] is a unique
      identifier for a span within a trace; it is a 16-character hexadecimal
      encoding of an 8-byte array.
    parentSpanId: The [SPAN_ID] of this span's parent span. If this is a root

    sameProcessAsParentSpan: (Optional) Set this parameter to indicate whether
      this span is in the same process as its parent. If you do not set this

      information.
    spanId: The [SPAN_ID] portion of the span's resource name.
    spanKind: Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context.
      For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using
      `CLIENT` (caller) and `SERVER` (callee) to identify an RPC call.
    startTime: The start time of the span. On the client side, this is the
      time kept by the local machine where the span execution starts. On the
