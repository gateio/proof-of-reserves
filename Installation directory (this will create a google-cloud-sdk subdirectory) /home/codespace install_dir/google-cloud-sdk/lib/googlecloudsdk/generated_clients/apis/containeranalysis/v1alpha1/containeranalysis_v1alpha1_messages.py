    pullTiming: Output only. Stores timing information for pulling this build
      step's builder image only.
    script: A shell script to be executed in the step. When script is
      provided, the user cannot specify the entrypoint or args.

      Cloud Key Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified
      in the build's `Secret`.
    status: Output only. Status of the build step. At this time, build step
      status is only updated on build completion; step status is not updated

      Otherwise, the build will succeed, but this step will still have a
      failure status. Error information will be reported in the failure_detail
      field.
    args: A list of arguments that will be presented to the step when it is
      started. If the image used to run the step's container has an
      entrypoint, the `args` are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the

      global option in BuildOption.
    dir: Working directory to use when running this step's container. If this
      value is a relative path, it is relative to the build's working
      directory. If this value is absolute, it may be outside the build's
      working directory, in which case the contents of the path may not be

      variable "KEY" being given the value "VALUE".
    exitCode: Output only. Return code from running the step.
    id: Unique identifier for this build step, used in `wait_for` to reference
      this build step as a dependency.
    name: Required. The name of the container image that will run this
      particular build step. If the image is available in the host's Docker
      daemon's cache, it will be run directly. If not, the host will attempt
      to pull the image first, using the builder service account's credentials

      versions of all of the officially supported build steps
      ([https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-
      builders](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders)). The

      you attempt to use them. If you built an image in a previous build step,
      it will be stored in the host's Docker daemon's cache and is available
      to use as the name for a later build step.
    pullTiming: Output only. Stores timing information for pulling this build
      step's builder image only.
    script: A shell script to be executed in the step. When script is
      provided, the user cannot specify the entrypoint or args.
    secretEnv: A list of environment variables which are encrypted using a
      Cloud Key Management Service crypto key. These values must be specified
      in the build's `Secret`.
    status: Output only. Status of the build step. At this time, build step
      status is only updated on build completion; step status is not updated
      in real-time as the build progresses.
    timeout: Time limit for executing this build step. If not defined, the
      step has no time limit and will be allowed to continue to run until
      either it completes or the build itself times out.
    timing: Output only. Stores timing information for executing this build
      step.
    volumes: List of volumes to mount into the build step. Each volume is
      created as an empty volume prior to execution of the build step. Upon
      completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Using
      a named volume in only one step is not valid as it is indicative of a
      build request with an incorrect configuration.
    waitFor: The ID(s) of the step(s) that this build step depends on. This
      build step will not start until all the build steps in `wait_for` have

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
