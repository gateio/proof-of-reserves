    confidentialInstanceConfig: Optional. A set of Compute Engine Confidential
      VM instance options.
    disablePublicIpAddresses: Optional. When set to true, disables public IP
      addresses for VMs. If you disable public IP addresses, you must set up
      Private Google Access or Cloud NAT on your network. If you use Private
      Google Access and you use `private.googleapis.com` or

      Registry, make sure that you set up DNS records for domains `*.gcr.io`
      and `*.pkg.dev`. Defaults to false (VMs have public IP addresses).
    disableSsh: Optional. Whether to disable SSH access to the VM.
    enableNestedVirtualization: Optional. Whether to enable nested
      virtualization on Cloud Workstations VMs created using this workstation
      configuration. Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM)
      instances inside your workstation. Before enabling nested
      virtualization, consider the following important considerations. Cloud
      Workstations instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute
      Engine
      instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-
      virtualization/overview#restrictions): * **Organization policy**:
      projects, folders, or organizations may be restricted from creating
      nested VMs if the **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is
      enforced in the organization policy. For more information, see the
      Compute Engine section, [Checking whether nested virtualization is
      allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-
      virtualization/managing-
      constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed). *
      **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater decrease
      in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and possibly greater
      than a 10% decrease for workloads that are input/output bound. *
      **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on
      workstation configurations that specify a machine_type in the N1 or N2
      machine series. * **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on
      workstation configurations with accelerators. * **Operating System**:
      Because [Container-Optimized
      OS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-
      optimized_os_cos) does not support nested virtualization, when nested
      virtualization is enabled, the underlying Compute Engine VM instances
      boot from an [Ubuntu
      LTS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts)
      image.
    machineType: Optional. The type of machine to use for VM instances-for
      example, `"e2-standard-4"`. For more information about machine types
      that Cloud Workstations supports, see the list of [available machine
      types](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/available-machine-
      types).
    poolSize: Optional. The number of VMs that the system should keep idle so
      that new workstations can be started quickly for new users. Defaults to
      `0` in the API.
    pooledInstances: Output only. Number of instances currently available in
      the pool for faster workstation startup.
    serviceAccount: Optional. The email address of the service account for
      Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration. When specified,
      be sure that the service account has `logginglogEntries.create`
      permission on the project so it can write logs out to Cloud Logging. If
      using a custom container image, the service account must have [Artifact
      Registry Reader](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-
      control#roles) permission to pull the specified image. If you as the
      administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, you need
      to set this value to a service account for which you have the
      `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission. Conversely, if you don't want
      anyone to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, use a service account
      where no one has that permission. If not set, VMs run with a service
      account provided by the Cloud Workstations service, and the image must
      be publicly accessible.
    serviceAccountScopes: Optional. Scopes to grant to the service_account.
      Various scopes are automatically added based on feature usage. When
      specified, users of workstations under this configuration must have
      `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` on the service account.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  platform teams can also use [Identity and Access Management

  Fields:
    annotations: Optional. Client-specified annotations.
    conditions: Output only. Status conditions describing the current resource
      state.
    container: Optional. Container that runs upon startup for each workstation
      using this workstation configuration.
    createTime: Output only. Time when this workstation configuration was
      created.
    degraded: Output only. Whether this resource is degraded, in which case it
      may require user action to restore full functionality. See also the
      conditions field.
    deleteTime: Output only. Time when this workstation configuration was
      soft-deleted.
    disableTcpConnections: Optional. Disables support for plain TCP
      connections in the workstation. By default the service supports TCP
      connections through a websocket relay. Setting this option to true
      disables that relay, which prevents the usage of services that require
      plain TCP connections, such as SSH. When enabled, all communication must
      occur over HTTPS or WSS.
    displayName: Optional. Human-readable name for this workstation
      configuration.
    enableAuditAgent: Optional. Whether to enable Linux `auditd` logging on
      the workstation. When enabled, a service account must also be specified
      that has `logging.buckets.write` permission on the project. Operating
      system audit logging is distinct from [Cloud Audit
      Logs](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/audit-logging).
    encryptionKey: Immutable. Encrypts resources of this workstation
      configuration using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK). If
      specified, the boot disk of the Compute Engine instance and the
      persistent disk are encrypted using this encryption key. If this field
      is not set, the disks are encrypted using a generated key. Customer-
      managed encryption keys do not protect disk metadata. If the customer-
      managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation instance is
      stopped, the system attempts to recreate the persistent disk with the
      new version of the key. Be sure to keep older versions of the key until
      the persistent disk is recreated. Otherwise, data on the persistent disk
      might be lost. If the encryption key is revoked, the workstation session
      automatically stops within 7 hours. Immutable after the workstation
      configuration is created.
    ephemeralDirectories: Optional. Ephemeral directories which won't persist
      across workstation sessions.
    etag: Optional. Checksum computed by the server. May be sent on update and
      delete requests to make sure that the client has an up-to-date value
      before proceeding.
    host: Optional. Runtime host for the workstation.
    idleTimeout: Optional. Number of seconds to wait before automatically
      stopping a workstation after it last received user traffic. A value of
      `"0s"` indicates that Cloud Workstations VMs created with this
      configuration should never time out due to idleness. Provide
      [duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-
      buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration) terminated by `s` for
      seconds-for example, `"7200s"` (2 hours). The default is `"1200s"` (20
      minutes).
    labels: Optional.
      [Labels](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/label-resources)
      that are applied to the workstation configuration and that are also
      propagated to the underlying Compute Engine resources.
    name: Identifier. Full name of this workstation configuration.
    persistentDirectories: Optional. Directories to persist across workstation
      sessions.
    readinessChecks: Optional. Readiness checks to perform when starting a
      workstation using this workstation configuration. Mark a workstation as
      running only after all specified readiness checks return 200 status
      codes.
    reconciling: Output only. Indicates whether this workstation configuration
      is currently being updated to match its intended state.
    replicaZones: Optional. Immutable. Specifies the zones used to replicate
      the VM and disk resources within the region. If set, exactly two zones
      within the workstation cluster's region must be specified-for example,
      `['us-central1-a', 'us-central1-f']`. If this field is empty, two
      default zones within the region are used. Immutable after the
      workstation configuration is created.
    runningTimeout: Optional. Number of seconds that a workstation can run
      until it is automatically shut down. We recommend that workstations be
      shut down daily to reduce costs and so that security updates can be
      applied upon restart. The idle_timeout and running_timeout fields are
      independent of each other. Note that the running_timeout field shuts
      down VMs after the specified time, regardless of whether or not the VMs
      are idle. Provide duration terminated by `s` for seconds-for example,
      `"54000s"` (15 hours). Defaults to `"43200s"` (12 hours). A value of
      `"0s"` indicates that workstations using this configuration should never
      time out. If encryption_key is set, it must be greater than `"0s"` and
      less than `"86400s"` (24 hours). Warning: A value of `"0s"` indicates
      that Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration have no
      maximum running time. This is strongly discouraged because you incur
      costs and will not pick up security updates.
    uid: Output only. A system-assigned unique identifier for this workstation
      configuration.
    updateTime: Output only. Time when this workstation configuration was most
      recently updated.
