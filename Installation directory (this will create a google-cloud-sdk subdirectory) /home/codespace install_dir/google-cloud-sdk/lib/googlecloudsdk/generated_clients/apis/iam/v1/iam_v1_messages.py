class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",

  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

  System-managed keys are automatically rotated by Google, and are used for
  signing for a maximum of two weeks. The rotation process is probabilistic,
  and usage of the new key will gradually ramp up and down over the key's
  lifetime. If you cache the public key set for a service account, we
  recommend that you update the cache every 15 minutes. User-managed keys can
  be added and removed at any time, so it is important to update the cache
  frequently. For Google-managed keys, Google will publish a key at least 6
  hours before it is first used for signing and will keep publishing it for at
  least 6 hours after it was last used for signing. Public keys for all

      are supported: * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating.
      You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject
      that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and the
      mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups the
      authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources
      using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all members of
      the group. * `google.display_name`: The name of the authenticated user.
      This is an optional field and the mapped display name cannot exceed 100

      all mapped attributes must not exceed 4KB. For OIDC providers, you must
      supply a custom mapping that includes the `google.subject` attribute.

      attributes mapped from the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`. The
      maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096 characters.

    AttributeMappingValue:  Maps attributes from authentication credentials
      issued by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such
      as `subject` and `segment`. Each key must be a string specifying the
      Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported:
      * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating. You can
      reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that
      appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. *
      `google.groups`: Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant
      groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access
      applies to all members of the group. You can also provide custom
      attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where
      `{custom_attribute}` is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped.
      You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of
      a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain
      the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM
      policies to define fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud
      resources. For example: * `google.subject`: `principal://iam.googleapis.

      /subject/{value}` * `google.groups`: `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/

      apis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{
      pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}` Each value must be a [Common
      Expression Language] (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function
      that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute
      specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion`
      keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the
      authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of
      an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the
      total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS
      providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default
      mapping applies: ``` { "google.subject":"assertion.arn",

      must include a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC
      providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the
      `google.subject` attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub`
      claim of the incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google

      boolean representing whether to allow the federation. The following
      keywords may be referenced in the expressions: * `assertion`: JSON
      representing the authentication credential issued by the provider. *
      `google`: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the
      `attribute_mappings`. * `attribute`: The custom attributes mapped from
      the assertion in the `attribute_mappings`. The maximum length of the
      attribute condition expression is 4096 characters. If unspecified, all
      valid authentication credential are accepted. The following example
      shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped `google.groups` value
      of `admins`: ``` "'admins' in google.groups" ```
    attributeMapping:  Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued
      by an external identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as

      Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: *
