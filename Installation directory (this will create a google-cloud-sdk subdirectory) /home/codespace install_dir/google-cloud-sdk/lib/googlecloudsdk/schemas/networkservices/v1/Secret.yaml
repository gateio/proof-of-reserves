      The name of the secret in Secret Manager. The resource name of the secret
      version must be in the format `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*` where the
      `*` values are replaced by the name of the secret. The secrets must be at
      least 16 bytes. The recommended secret size depends on the signature
      algorithm that you're using. * If you're using `HMAC-SHA1`, we recommend
      20-byte secrets. * If you're using `HMAC-SHA256`, we recommend 32-byte
      secrets. See RFC 2104, Section 3 for more details on these
      recommendations.
