      The percentage threshold that a load balancer will begin to send traffic
      to failover backends. If the percentage of endpoints in a MIG/NEG is
      smaller than this value, traffic would be sent to failover backends if
      possible. This field should be set to a value between 1 and 99. The
      default value is 50 for Global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic)
      and Proxyless service mesh, and 70 for others.
