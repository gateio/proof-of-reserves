  connectTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for a single origin connection to be
      established, including DNS lookup, TLS handshake, and TCP/QUIC connection
      establishment. Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between
      1s and 15s. The `connect_timeout` capped by the deadline set by the
      request's max_attempts_timeout. The last connection attempt can have a
      smaller `connect_timeout` so that the total `max_attempts_timeout` value
      is not exceeded.
    type: string
  maxAttemptsTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum time across all connection attempts to all origins, including
      failover origins, before returning an error to the client. An `HTTP 504`
      error is returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
      Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s. If
      a failover origin is specified, the `max_attempts_timeout` value of the
      first configured origin sets the deadline for all connection attempts
      across all failover origins.
    type: string
  readTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait between reads of a single HTTP connection or
      stream. Defaults to 15 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and
      30s. The `read_timeout` value is capped by the response_timeout value. All
      reads of the HTTP connection or stream must be completed by the deadline
      set by response_timeout. If the response headers have already been written
      to the connection, the response is truncated and logged.
    type: string
  responseTimeout:
    description: |-
      The maximum duration to wait for the last byte of a response to arrive
      when reading from the HTTP connection/stream. Defaults to 30 seconds. The
      timeout must be a value between 1s and 120s. The `response_timeout` starts
      after the connection has been established. Origins that take longer to
      write additional bytes to the response than the configured
      `response_timeout` value result in an error returned to the client. If the
      response headers have already been written to the connection, the response
      is truncated and logged.
