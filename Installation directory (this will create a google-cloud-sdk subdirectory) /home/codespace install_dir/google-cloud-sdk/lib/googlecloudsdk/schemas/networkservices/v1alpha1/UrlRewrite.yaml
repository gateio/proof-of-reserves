      Before forwarding the request to the selected origin, the matching portion
      of the request's path is replaced by `path_prefix_rewrite`. If specified,
      the path value must start with a `/` and be between 1 and 1024 characters
      long (inclusive). `path_prefix_rewrite` can only be used when all of a
      route's match_rules specify prefix_match or full_path_match. Only one of
      `path_prefix_rewrite` and path_template_rewrite can be specified.
    type: string
  pathTemplateRewrite:
    description: |-
      Before forwarding the request to the selected origin, if the request
      matched a path_template_match, the matching portion of the request's path
      is replaced re-written using the pattern specified by
      `path_template_rewrite`. `path_template_rewrite` must be between 1 and 255
      characters (inclusive), must start with a `/`, and must only use variables
      captured by the route's `path_template_match`. `path_template_rewrite` can
      only be used when all of a route's match_rules specify
      `path_template_match`. Only one of path_prefix_rewrite and
      `path_template_rewrite` can be specified.
