      Zero or more addresses with ports in format of ":" that the Router must
      receive traffic on. The proxy binds to the ports specified. IP address can
      be anything that is allowed by the underlying infrastructure (auto-
      allocation, static IP, BYOIP). Must be unset if the interceptionPort is
      set as interceptionPort configures the Router to listen on the localhost
      address instead.

  interceptionPort:
    description: |-
      If set to a valid TCP port (1-65535), instructs Router to listen on
      the specified port of localhost (127.0.0.1) address. Router will
      expect all traffic to be redirected to this port regardless of its
      actual ip:port destination.
