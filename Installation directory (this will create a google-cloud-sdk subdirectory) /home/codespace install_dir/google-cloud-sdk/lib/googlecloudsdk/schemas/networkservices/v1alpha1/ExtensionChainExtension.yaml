  authority:
    description: |-
      The `:authority` header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the
      extension service. Required for Callout extensions.
    type: string
  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or
      times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also
      executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used,
      one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been
      delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the
      client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error
      response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered,
      then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
    type: boolean
  forwardHeaders:
    description: |-
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client or
      backend). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string
      indicating the header name.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  name:
    description: |-
      The name for this extension. The name is logged as part of the HTTP
      request logs. The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to
      lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens, and can have a maximum
      length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a
      letter and the last a letter or a number.
    type: string
  service:
    description: |-
      The reference to the service that runs the extension. Currently only
      callout extensions are supported here. To configure a callout
      extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a [backend
      service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v
      1/backendServices) in the format:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1
      /projects/{project}/regions/{region}/backendServices/{backendService}`
      or
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/back
      endServices/{backendService}`.
    type: string
  supportedEvents:
    description: |-
      A set of events during request or response processing for which this
      extension is called. This field is required for the
      `LbTrafficExtension` resource. It's not relevant for the
      `LbRouteExtension` resource.

      - RESPONSE_TRAILERS
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream.
      The timeout must be between 10-1000 milliseconds. Required for
      Callout extensions.
