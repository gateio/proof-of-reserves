      The ID of the public key. The ID must be 1-64 characters long, and match
      the regular expression `[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9_-])*` which means the first
      character must be a letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      an underscore, a letter, or a digit.
    type: string
  managed:
    description: |-
      Set to `true` to have the CDN automatically manage this public key.
      Managed keys are used by the CDN for dual-token authentication. Media CDN
      internally generates, uses, and rotates the underlying public and private
      key pair. It is not possible to use a managed key outside of dual-token
      authentication. Either `value` or `managed` must be specified.
    type: boolean
  value:
    description: |-
      The base64-encoded value of the Ed25519 public key. The base64 encoding
      can be padded (44 bytes) or unpadded (43 bytes). Representations or
      encodings of the public key other than this are rejected with an error.
      Either `value` or `managed` must be specified.
