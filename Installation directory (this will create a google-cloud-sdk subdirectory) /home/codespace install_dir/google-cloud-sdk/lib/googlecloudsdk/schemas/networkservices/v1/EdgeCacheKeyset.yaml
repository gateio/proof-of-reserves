      The name of the resource as provided by the client when the resource is

      be a letter, and all following characters must be a dash, an underscore, a
      letter, or a digit.
    type: string
  publicKeys:
    description: |-
      An ordered list of Ed25519 public keys to use for validating signed
      requests. Ed25519 public keys are not secret and only allow Google to
      validate that a request was signed by your corresponding private key.
      Ensure that the private key is kept secret and that only authorized users
      can add public keys to a keyset. You can rotate keys by appending
      (pushing) a new key to the list of public keys, and removing any
      superseded keys. You must specify `public_keys` or validation_shared_keys
      (or both). The keys in `public_keys` are checked first. You can specify at
      most one Google-managed public key. If you specify `public_keys`, you must
      specify at least one key and can specify up to three keys.

  validationSharedKeys:
    description: |-
      An ordered list of shared keys to use for validating signed requests.
      Shared keys are secret. Ensure that only authorized users can add
      `validation_shared_keys` to a keyset. You can rotate keys by appending
      (pushing) a new key to the list of `validation_shared_keys` and
      removing any superseded keys. You must specify public_keys or
      `validation_shared_keys` (or both). The keys in `public_keys` are
      checked first. If you specify `validation_shared_keys`, you must
      specify at least one key and can specify up to three keys.
