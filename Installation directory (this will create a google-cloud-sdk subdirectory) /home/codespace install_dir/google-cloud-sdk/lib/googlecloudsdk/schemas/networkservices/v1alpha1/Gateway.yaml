  addresses:
    description: |-
      Zero or one IPv4 or IPv6 address on which the Gateway will receive the
      traffic. When no address is provided, an IP from the subnetwork is
      allocated This field only applies to gateways of type
      'SECURE_WEB_GATEWAY'. Gateways of type 'OPEN_MESH' listen on 0.0.0.0 for
      IPv4 and :: for IPv6.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  authorizationPolicy:
    description: |-

      traffic is authorized. If empty, authorization checks are disabled.
    type: string
  certificateUrls:
    description: |-
      A fully-qualified Certificates URL reference. The proxy presents a
      Certificate (selected based on SNI) when establishing a TLS
      connection. This feature only applies to gateways of type
      'SECURE_WEB_GATEWAY'.

    - DEBUG_HEADERS
    - ENVOY_HEADERS_UNSPECIFIED
    - NONE
  gatewaySecurityPolicy:
    description: |-
      A fully-qualified GatewaySecurityPolicy URL reference. Defines how
      a server should apply security policy to inbound (VM to Proxy)
      initiated connections. For example:
      `projects/*/locations/*/gatewaySecurityPolicies/swg-policy`. This
      policy is specific to gateways of type 'SECURE_WEB_GATEWAY'.
    type: string
  ipVersion:
    description: |-
      The IP Version that will be used by this gateway. Valid options
      are IPV4 or IPV6. Default is IPV4.

    type: string
  ports:
    description: |-
      One or more port numbers (1-65535), on which the Gateway will

      of type 'SECURE_WEB_GATEWAY' are limited to 1 port. Gateways of
      type 'OPEN_MESH' listen on 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 and :: for IPv6 and
      support multiple ports.
    type: array
    items:
      type: integer
  scope:
    description: |-
      Scope determines how configuration across multiple Gateway
      instances are merged. The configuration for multiple Gateway
      instances with the same scope will be merged as presented as a
      single coniguration to the proxy/load balancer. Max length 64
