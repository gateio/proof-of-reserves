      The specification for modifying the headers of a matching request prior to
      delivery of the request to the destination. If HeaderModifiers are set on
      both the Destination and the RouteAction, they will be merged. Conflicts
      between the two will not be resolved on the configuration.

      The specification for modifying the headers of a response prior to sending
      the response back to the client. If HeaderModifiers are set on both the
      Destination and the RouteAction, they will be merged. Conflicts between
      the two will not be resolved on the configuration.

    type: string
  weight:
    description: |-
      Specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the backend referenced
      by the serviceName field. This is computed as: - weight/Sum(weights in
      this destination list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon
      from the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
      implementation supports. If only one serviceName is specified and it has a
      weight greater than 0, 100% of the traffic is forwarded to that backend.
      If weights are specified for any one service name, they need to be
      specified for all of them. If weights are unspecified for all services,
      then, traffic is distributed in equal proportions to all of them.
