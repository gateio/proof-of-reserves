  scope:
    description: |-
      Scope is used to identify Routers of the same type configuration of
      which should apply to the same infrastructure component(s). For
      example: if there are multiple Routers of type PROXY with the same
      value of the scope, proxies requesting the configuration using this
      value will receive a joint configuration of all Routers in the scope.
      Clients can request configuration for a particular scope by specifying
      its value in their request. Refer to the product documentation for the
      product-specific way of specifying request parameters. Max length 64
      characters. Scope should start with a letter and can only have
      letters, numbers, hyphens.
