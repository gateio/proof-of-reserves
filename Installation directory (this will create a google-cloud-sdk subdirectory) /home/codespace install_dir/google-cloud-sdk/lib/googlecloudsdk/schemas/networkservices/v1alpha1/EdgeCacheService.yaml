  disableHttp2:
    description: |-
      Disables HTTP/2. HTTP/2 (h2) is enabled by default and recommended for
      performance. HTTP/2 improves connection re-use and reduces connection
      setup overhead by sending multiple streams over the same connection. Some
      legacy HTTP clients might have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to
      broken HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to `true` prevents HTTP/2 from
      being advertised and negotiated.

      users and the EdgeCacheService resource. Note that only global
      certificates with a scope of `EDGE_CACHE` can be attached to an
      EdgeCacheService resource. The following are both valid paths to an
      `edge_ssl_certificates` resource: *
      `projects/project/locations/global/certificates/media-example-com-cert` *
      `media-example-com-cert` You can specify up to five SSL certificates.

  requireTls:

      Clients who connect over HTTP (port 80) see an `HTTP 301` response to

      edge_ssl_certificates specified to enable this.
