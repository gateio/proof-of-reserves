      Must be specified in the CIDR range format. A CIDR range consists of an IP
      Address and a prefix length to construct the subnet mask. By default, the
      prefix length is 32 (i.e. matches a single IP address). Only IPV4
      addresses are supported. Examples: "10.0.0.1" - matches against this exact
      IP address. "10.0.0.0/8" - matches against any IP address within the
      10.0.0.0 subnet and 255.255.255.0 mask. "0.0.0.0/0" - matches against any
      IP address'.
