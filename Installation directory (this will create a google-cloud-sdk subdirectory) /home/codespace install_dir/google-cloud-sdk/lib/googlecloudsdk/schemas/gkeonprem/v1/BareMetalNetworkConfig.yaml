      Load Balancing with BGP or the egress NAT gateway. Setting configuration

  islandModeCidr:
    description: |-
      Configuration for island mode CIDR. In an island-mode network, nodes have
      unique IP addresses, but pods don't have unique addresses across clusters.
      This doesn't cause problems because pods in one cluster never directly
      communicate with pods in another cluster. Instead, there are gateways that
      mediate between a pod in one cluster and a pod in another cluster.
