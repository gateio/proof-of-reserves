  caPool:
    description: |-
      A CA pool resource used to issue interception certificates. The CA pool
      string has a relative resource path following the form
      "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/caPools/{ca_pool}".

  excludePublicCaSet:
    description: |-
      If FALSE (the default), use our default set of public CAs in addition to
      any CAs specified in trust_config. These public CAs are currently based on
      the Mozilla Root Program and are subject to change over time. If TRUE, do
      not accept our default set of public CAs. Only CAs specified in
      trust_config will be accepted. This defaults to FALSE (use public CAs in
      addition to trust_config) for backwards compatibility, but trusting public
      root CAs is *not recommended* unless the traffic in question is outbound
      to public web servers. When possible, prefer setting this to "false" and
      explicitly specifying trusted CAs and certificates in a TrustConfig. Note
      that Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor this field.
    type: boolean
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Name is of the form projects/{projec
      t}/locations/{location}/tlsInspectionPolicies/{tls_inspection_policy}
      tls_inspection_policy should match the
      pattern:(^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$).
    type: string
  trustConfig:
    description: |-
      A TrustConfig resource used when making a connection to the TLS server.
      This is a relative resource path following the form
      "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/trustConfigs/{trust_config}".
      This is necessary to intercept TLS connections to servers with
      certificates signed by a private CA or self-signed certificates. Note that
      Secure Web Proxy does not yet honor this field.
