  requestId:
    description: |-
      A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if
      you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if
      it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least
      60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation
      where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make
      the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if
      original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will
      ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally
      creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with
      the exception that zero UUID is not supported
      (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

  updateMask:
    description: |-
      Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the stream
      resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are
      relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be
      overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then
      all fields will be overwritten.
    type: string
  validateOnly:
    description: |-
      Only validate the stream with the changes, without actually updating it.
      The default is false.
