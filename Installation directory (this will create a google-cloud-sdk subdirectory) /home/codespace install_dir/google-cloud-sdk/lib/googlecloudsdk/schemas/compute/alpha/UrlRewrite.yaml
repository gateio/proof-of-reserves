    description: |-

    type: string
  pathTemplateRewrite:
    description: |-
      If specified, the pattern rewrites the URL path (based on the :path
      header) using the HTTP template syntax. A corresponding
      path_template_match must be specified. Any template variables must exist
      in the path_template_match field. - -At least one variable must be
      specified in the path_template_match field - You can omit variables from
      the rewritten URL - The * and ** operators cannot be matched unless they
      have a corresponding variable name - e.g. {format=*} or {var=**}. For
      example, a path_template_match of /static/{format=**} could be rewritten
      as /static/content/{format} to prefix /content to the URL. Variables can
      also be re-ordered in a rewrite, so that /{country}/{format}/{suffix=**}
      can be rewritten as /content/{format}/{country}/{suffix}. At least one
      non-empty routeRules[].matchRules[].path_template_match is required. Only
      one of path_prefix_rewrite or path_template_rewrite may be specified.
