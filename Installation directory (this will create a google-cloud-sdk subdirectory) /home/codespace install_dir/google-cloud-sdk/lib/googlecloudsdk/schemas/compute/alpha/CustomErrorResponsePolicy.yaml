  errorResponseRules:
    description: |-
      Specifies rules for returning error responses. In a given policy, if you
      specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for
      specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher
      priority. For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-
      authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX). If the
      backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied.
      However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes
      effect.

  errorService:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL to the BackendBucket resource that contains
      the custom error content. Examples are: - https://www.googleapi s.com/
      compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket -
      compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket -
      global/backendBuckets/myBackendBucket If errorService is not specified
      at lower levels like pathMatcher, pathRule and routeRule, an
      errorService specified at a higher level in the UrlMap will be used.
      If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more
      errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService. If load balancer
      cannot reach the backendBucket, a simple Not Found Error will be
      returned, with the original response code (or overrideResponseCode if
      configured). errorService is not supported for internal or regional
      HTTP/HTTPS load balancers.
