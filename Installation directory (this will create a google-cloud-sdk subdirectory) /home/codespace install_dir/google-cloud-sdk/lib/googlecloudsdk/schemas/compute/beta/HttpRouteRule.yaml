  customErrorResponsePolicy:
    description: |-
      customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error
      responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. If a
      policy for an error code is not configured for the RouteRule, a policy for
      the error code configured in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
      is applied. If one is not specified in
      pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the policy configured in
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. For example,
      consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: -
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies for
      5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the
      error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is
      encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
      takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request
      www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If
      however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404,
      the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of
      the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in
      conjunction with routeRules.routeAction.retryPolicy, retries take
      precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
      customErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load
      balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
      customErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is
      returned to the client. customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for
      Global External HTTP(S) load balancing.

      The short description conveying the intent of this routeRule. The
      description can have a maximum length of 1024 characters.
    type: string
  headerAction:
    description: |-
      Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect
      for the selected backendService. The headerAction value specified here is
      applied before the matching pathMatchers[].headerAction and after
      pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeA
      ction.weightedBackendService.backendServiceWeightAction[].headerAction
      HeaderAction is not supported for load balancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.

  httpFilterConfigs:
    description: |-
      Outbound route specific configuration for networkservices.HttpFilter
      resources enabled by Traffic Director. httpFilterConfigs only applies for
      load balancers with loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See
      ForwardingRule for more details. Not supported when the URL map is bound
      to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

  httpFilterMetadata:

      httpFilterMetadata only applies for load balancers with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule
      for more details. The only configTypeUrl supported is
      type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Struct Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless
      field set to true.

  matchRules:
    description: |-
      The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to this
      routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this
      routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However
      predicates within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All
      predicates within a matchRule must match for the request to match
      the rule.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: HttpRouteRuleMatch.yaml
  priority:
    description: |-
      For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines
      the order in which a load balancer interprets routeRules.
      RouteRules are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest
      to highest number. The priority of a rule decreases as its
      number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule that matches
      the request is applied. You cannot configure two or more
      routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must
      be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. Priority
      numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
      in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For
      example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of
      priority numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6
      to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact
      on existing rules.
    type: integer
  routeAction:
    description: |-
      In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer
      performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and
      header transformations, before forwarding the request to the
      selected backend. If routeAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely
      if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. URL maps for
      Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the
      urlRewrite action within a route rule's routeAction.
    $ref: HttpRouteAction.yaml
  service:
    description: |-
      The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to
      which traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If
      routeAction is also specified, advanced routing actions, such
      as URL rewrites, take effect before sending the request to the
      backend. However, if service is specified, routeAction cannot
      contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if
      routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service
      must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    type: string
  urlRedirect:
    description: |-
      When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service
      or routeAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map
      is bound to a target gRPC proxy.
