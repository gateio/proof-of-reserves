      type: string
  automaticRestart:
    description: |-
      Specifies whether the instance should be automatically restarted if it is
      terminated by Compute Engine (not terminated by a user). You can only set
      the automatic restart option for standard instances. Preemptible instances
      cannot be automatically restarted. By default, this is set to true so an
      instance is automatically restarted if it is terminated by Compute Engine.
    type: boolean
  hostErrorTimeoutSeconds:
    description: |-
      Specify the time in seconds for host error detection, the value must be
      within the range of [90, 330] with the increment of 30, if unset, the
      default behavior of host error recovery will be used.
    type: integer
  instanceTerminationAction:
    description: Specifies the termination action for the instance.
    type: string
    enum:
    - DELETE
    - STOP
  locationHint:
    description: |-
      An opaque location hint used to place the instance close to other
      resources. This field is for use by internal tools that use the public
      API.
    type: string
  maxRunDuration:
    description: |-
      Specifies the max run duration for the given instance. If specified, the
      instance termination action will be performed at the end of the run
      duration.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  localSsdRecoveryTimeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the maximum amount of time a Local Ssd Vm should wait while
      recovery of the Local Ssd state is attempted. Its value should be in
      between 0 and 168 hours with hour granularity and the default value being 1
      hour.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  minNodeCpus:
    description: |-
      The minimum number of virtual CPUs this instance will consume when running
      on a sole-tenant node.
    type: integer
  nodeAffinities:
    description: |-
      A set of node affinity and anti-affinity configurations. Refer to
      Configuring node affinity for more information. Overrides
      reservationAffinity.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: SchedulingNodeAffinity.yaml
  onHostMaintenance:
    description: |-
      Defines the maintenance behavior for this instance. For standard
      instances, the default behavior is MIGRATE. For preemptible instances,
      the default and only possible behavior is TERMINATE. For more
      information, see Setting Instance Scheduling Options.
    type: string
    enum:
    - MIGRATE
    - TERMINATE
  preemptible:
    description: |-
      Defines whether the instance is preemptible. This can only be set
      during instance creation or while the instance is stopped and
      therefore, in a `TERMINATED` state. See Instance Life Cycle for more
      information on the possible instance states.
    type: boolean
  provisioningModel:
    description: Specifies the provisioning model of the instance.
    type: string
    enum:
    - SPOT
  terminationTime:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timestamp, when the instance will be terminated, in
      RFC3339 text format. If specified, the instance termination action
      will be performed at the termination time.
    type: string
  maintenaceInterval:
    description: |-
      Specifies the frequency of planned maintenance events.
    type: string
    enum:
    - PERIODIC
