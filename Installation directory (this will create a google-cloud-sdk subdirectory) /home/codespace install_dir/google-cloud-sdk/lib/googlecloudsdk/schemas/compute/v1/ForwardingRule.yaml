  IPAddress:
    description: |-
      IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends traffic
      to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the target
      that you specify in the forwarding rule. If you don't specify a reserved
      IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned. Methods for specifying an
      IP address: * IPv4 dotted decimal, as in `100.1.2.3` * Full URL, as in
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region
      /addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: -
      projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name -
      regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name -
      address-name The loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target
      determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed
      information, see [IP address
      specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-
      rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). Must be set to `0.0.0.0` when
      the target is targetGrpcProxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
      Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
    type: string
  IPProtocol:
    description: |-
      The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid
      options are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP and L3_DEFAULT. The valid IP
      protocols are different for different load balancing products as described
      in [Load balancing features](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/features#protocol
      s_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).
    type: string
    enum:
    - AH
    - ESP
    - ICMP
    - L3_DEFAULT
    - SCTP
    - TCP
    - UDP
  allPorts:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for Internal
      TCP/UDP Load Balancing or Network Load Balancing, or with the target field
      for internal and external TargetInstance. You can only use one of ports
      and port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive. For TCP,
      UDP and SCTP traffic, packets addressed to any ports will be forwarded to
      the target or backendService.
    type: boolean
  allowGlobalAccess:
    description: |-
      This field is used along with the backend_service field for internal load
      balancing or with the target field for internal TargetInstance. If the
      field is set to TRUE, clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise
      only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load
      balancer.
    type: boolean
  backendService:
    description: |-
      Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic.
      Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing;
      must be omitted for all other load balancer types.

    type: string
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  ipVersion:
    description: |-
      The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options
      are IPV4 or IPV6. This can only be specified for an external global
      forwarding rule.
    type: string
    enum:
    - IPV4
    - IPV6
    - UNSPECIFIED_VERSION
  isMirroringCollector:
    description: |-
      Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for
      packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load
      balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a PacketMirroring
      rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that
      have their loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL.
    type: boolean
  kind:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule for
      Forwarding Rule resources.
    type: string
  labelFingerprint:
    description: |-
      A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this resource, which is
      essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic locking. The
      fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after
      every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-
      to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels, otherwise
      the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest
      fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    type: string
  labels:
    description: |-
      Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by the
      setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with RFC1035.
      Label values may be empty.
    $ref: LabelsValue.yaml
  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      Specifies the forwarding rule type. For more information about forwarding
      rules, refer to Forwarding rule concepts.
    type: string

    - INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED
    - INVALID
  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata. When there
      is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies.
      Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced by
      the ForwardingRule are not visible to those proxies. For each
      metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to
      MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding
      label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to
      MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding
      labels provided in the metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are
      specified, all of them need to be satisfied in order to be considered a
      match. metadataFilters specified here will be applifed before those
      specified in the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
      metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: MetadataFilter.yaml
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect
      forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding
      rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and
      numbers and must start with a letter.
    type: string
  network:
    description: |-
      This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal
      TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the
      load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this
      field is not specified, the default network will be used. For Private
      Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs,
      a network must be provided.
    type: string
  networkTier:
    description: |-
      This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load
      balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and
      STANDARD. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM. If
      this field is not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress
      is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the
      Address.
    type: string
    enum:
    - FIXED_STANDARD
    - PREMIUM
    - STANDARD
    - STANDARD_OVERRIDES_FIXED_STANDARD
  portRange:
    description: |-
      This field can be used only if: - Load balancing scheme is one of
      EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or INTERNAL_MANAGED - IPProtocol is
      one of TCP, UDP, or SCTP. Packets addressed to ports in the specified
      range will be forwarded to target or backend_service. You can only use
      one of ports, port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually
      exclusive. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair
      must have disjoint ports. Some types of forwarding target have
      constraints on the acceptable ports. For more information, see [Port
      specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding- rule-concepts#port_specifications).
      @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
    type: string
  ports:
    description: |-
      The ports field is only supported when the forwarding rule references
      a backend_service directly. Only packets addressed to the [specified
      list of ports]((https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)) are
      forwarded to backends. You can only use one of ports and port_range,
      or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive. You can specify a list
      of up to five ports, which can be non-contiguous. Forwarding rules
      with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint ports.

      Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully
      qualified service name. The label must be 1-63 characters
      long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be
      1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for
      internal load balancing.
    type: string
