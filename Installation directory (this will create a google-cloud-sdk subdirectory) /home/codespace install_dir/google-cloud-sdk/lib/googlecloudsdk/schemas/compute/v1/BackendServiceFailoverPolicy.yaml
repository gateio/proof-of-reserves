      This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP. The default is false.
    type: boolean
  dropTrafficIfUnhealthy:
    description: |-
      If set to true, connections to the load balancer are dropped when all
      primary and all backup backend VMs are unhealthy.If set to false,
      connections are distributed among all primary VMs when all primary and all
      backup backend VMs are unhealthy. For load balancers that have
      configurable failover: [Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/internal/failover-overview) and [external TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/network/networklb-failover-overview). The default is false.
    type: boolean
  failoverRatio:
    description: |-
      The value of the field must be in the range [0, 1]. If the value is 0, the
      load balancer performs a failover when the number of healthy primary VMs
      equals zero. For all other values, the load balancer performs a failover
      when the total number of healthy primary VMs is less than this ratio. For
      load balancers that have configurable failover: [Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/internal/failover-overview) and [external TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
