  fullPathMatch:
    description: |-
      For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the request must
      exactly match the value specified in fullPathMatch after removing any
      query parameters and anchor that may be part of the original URL.
      fullPathMatch must be from 1 to 1024 characters. Only one of prefixMatch,
      fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be specified.
    type: string
  headerMatches:
    description: |-
      Specifies a list of header match criteria, all of which must match
      corresponding headers in the request.

      $ref: HttpHeaderMatch.yaml
  ignoreCase:
    description: |-
      Specifies that prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case
      sensitive. The default value is false. ignoreCase must not be used
      with regexMatch. Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target
      gRPC proxy.
    type: boolean
  metadataFilters:
    description: |-
      Opaque filter criteria used by the load balancer to restrict routing
      configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
      requests to the load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata. When
      there is a match, the relevant routing configuration is made available
      to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its
      filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
      filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
      metadata. If multiple metadata filters are specified, all of them need
      to be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters
      specified here is applied after those specified in ForwardingRule that
      refers to the UrlMap this HttpRouteRuleMatch belongs to.
      metadataFilters only applies to load balancers that have
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Not supported when
      the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.

  pathTemplateMatch:
    description: |-
      If specified, the route is a pattern match expression that must
      match the :path header once the query string is removed. A pattern
      match allows you to match - The value must be between 1 and 1024
      characters - The pattern must start with a leading slash ("/") -
      There may be no more than 5 operators in pattern Precisely one of
      prefix_match, full_path_match, regex_match or path_template_match
      must be set.
    type: string
  prefixMatch:
    description: |-
      For satisfying the matchRule condition, the request's path must
      begin with the specified prefixMatch. prefixMatch must begin with
      a /. The value must be from 1 to 1024 characters. Only one of
      prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be specified.
    type: string
  queryParameterMatches:
    description: |-
      Specifies a list of query parameter match criteria, all of which
      must match corresponding query parameters in the request. Not
      supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: HttpQueryParameterMatch.yaml
  regexMatch:
    description: |-
      For satisfying the matchRule condition, the path of the
      request must satisfy the regular expression specified in
      regexMatch after removing any query parameters and anchor
      supplied with the original URL. For more information about
      regular expression syntax, see Syntax. Only one of
      prefixMatch, fullPathMatch or regexMatch must be specified.
      Regular expressions can only be used when the
      loadBalancingScheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
