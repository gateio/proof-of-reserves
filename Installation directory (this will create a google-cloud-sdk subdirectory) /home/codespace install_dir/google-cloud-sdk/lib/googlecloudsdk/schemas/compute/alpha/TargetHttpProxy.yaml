      URLs to networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled for xDS clients using

      locationhttpFilters/httpFilter Only filters that handle outbound
      connection and stream events may be specified. These filters work in
      conjunction with a default set of HTTP filters that may already be
      configured by Traffic Director. Traffic Director will determine the final
      location of these filters within xDS configuration based on the name of
      the HTTP filter. If Traffic Director positions multiple filters at the
      same location, those filters will be in the same order as specified in
      this list. httpFilters only applies for loadbalancers with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for
      more details.

  httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec:
    description: |-
      Specifies how long to keep a connection open, after completing a
      response, while there is no matching traffic (in seconds). If an HTTP
      keep-alive is not specified, a default value (610 seconds) will be
      used. For Global external HTTP(S) load balancer, the minimum allowed
      value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is 1200 seconds. For
      Global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic), this option is not
      available publicly.

      [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpProxy for
      target HTTP proxies.
    type: string
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    type: string
  proxyBind:
    description: |-
      This field only applies when the forwarding rule that references this
      target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
      When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set up inbound traffic
      interception and bind to the IP address and port specified in the
      forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using Traffic Director
      to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in other words, not a
      sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound requests and
      handles requests when it receives them. The default is false.
    type: boolean

    description: |-
