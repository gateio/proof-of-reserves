    items:
      type: string
  authorizationPolicy:
    description: |-
      A URL referring to a networksecurity.AuthorizationPolicy resource that
      describes how the proxy should authorize inbound traffic. If left blank,
      access will not be restricted by an authorization policy. Refer to the
      AuthorizationPolicy resource for additional details. authorizationPolicy
      only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy attached to
      globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: string
  certificateMap:
    description: |-
      URL of a certificate map that identifies a certificate map associated with
      the given target proxy. This field can only be set for global target
      proxies. If set, sslCertificates will be ignored. Accepted format is
      //certificatemanager.googleapis.com/projects/{project
      }/locations/{location}/certificateMaps/{resourceName}.
    type: string
  creationTimestamp:
    description: '[Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.'
    type: string
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  httpKeepAliveTimeoutSec:
    description: |-
      Specifies how long to keep a connection open, after completing a
      response, while there is no matching traffic (in seconds). If an HTTP
      keep-alive is not specified, a default value (610 seconds) will be
      used. For Global external HTTP(S) load balancer, the minimum allowed
      value is 5 seconds and the maximum allowed value is 1200 seconds. For
      Global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic), this option is not
      available publicly.
    type: integer
  kind:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpsProxy for
      target HTTPS proxies.
    type: string
  name:
    description: |-
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    type: string
  proxyBind:
    description: |-
      This field only applies when the forwarding rule that references this
      target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
      When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set up inbound traffic
      interception and bind to the IP address and port specified in the
      forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using Traffic Director
      to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in other words, not a
      sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound requests and
      handles requests when it receives them. The default is false.
    type: boolean
  quicOverride:
    description: |-
      Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy resource.
      This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to
      negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE.
      - When quic-override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is
      used. - When quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses
      QUIC when possible. - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load
      balancer doesn't use QUIC. - If the quic-override flag is not
      specified, NONE is implied.
    type: string
    enum:
    - DISABLE
    - ENABLE
    - NONE
  region:
    description: |-
      [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional TargetHttpsProxy
      resides. This field is not applicable to global TargetHttpsProxies.
    type: string
  selfLink:
    description: '[Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.'
    type: string
  serverTlsPolicy:
    description: |-
      A URL referring to a networksecurity.ServerTlsPolicy resource that
      describes how the proxy should authenticate inbound traffic.
      serverTlsPolicy only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy attached to
      globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. For details
      which ServerTlsPolicy resources are accepted with
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and which with EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED
      loadBalancingScheme consult ServerTlsPolicy documentation. If left
      blank, communications are not encrypted.
    type: string
  sslCertificates:
    description: |-
      URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to authenticate
      connections between users and the load balancer. At least one SSL
      certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to 15 SSL
      certificates. sslCertificates do not apply when the load balancing
      scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  sslPolicy:
    description: |-
      URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the
      TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy
      resource has no SSL policy configured.
    type: string
  urlMap:
    description: |-
      A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that
      defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example,
      the following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map: -
      https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/
      url- map - projects/project/global/urlMaps/url-map -
      global/urlMaps/url-map
