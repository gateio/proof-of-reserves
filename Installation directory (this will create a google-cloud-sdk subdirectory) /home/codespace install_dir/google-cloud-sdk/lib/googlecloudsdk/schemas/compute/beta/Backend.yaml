  balancingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies how to determine whether the backend of a load balancer can
      handle additional traffic or is fully loaded. For usage guidelines, see
      Connection balancing mode. Backends must use compatible balancing modes.
      For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity
      settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups. Note:
      Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes,
      the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is
      ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when
      Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible
      combination will be rejected.
    type: string
    enum:
    - CONNECTION
    - RATE
    - UTILIZATION
  capacityScaler:
    description: |-
      A multiplier applied to the backend's target capacity of its balancing
      mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of
      its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means
      the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity.
      The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting
      larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0
      when there is only one backend attached to the backend service. Not
      available with backends that don't support using a balancingMode. This
      includes backends such as global internet NEGs, regional serverless NEGs,
      and PSC NEGs.

    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  failover:
    description: |-
      This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one
      failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    type: boolean
  group:
    description: |-
      The fully-qualified URL of an instance group or network endpoint group
      (NEG) resource. To determine what types of backends a load balancer
      supports, see the [Backend services
      overview](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service#backends). You must use the *fully-qualified* URL (starting with
      https://www.googleapis.com/) to specify the instance group or NEG. Partial
      URLs are not supported.
    type: string
  maxConnections:
    description: |-
      Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous connections. For usage
      guidelines, see Connection balancing mode and Utilization balancing mode.
      Not available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous connections. For usage
      guidelines, see Connection balancing mode and Utilization balancing mode.
      Not available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE.
    type: integer
  maxConnectionsPerInstance:
    description: |-
      Defines a target maximum number of simultaneous connections. For usage
      guidelines, see Connection balancing mode and Utilization balancing mode.
      Not available if the backend's balancingMode is RATE.
    type: integer
  maxRate:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum number of HTTP requests per second (RPS). For usage
      guidelines, see Rate balancing mode and Utilization balancing mode. Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: integer
  maxRatePerEndpoint:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS). For usage
      guidelines, see Rate balancing mode and Utilization balancing mode. Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: number
  maxRatePerInstance:
    description: |-
      Defines a maximum target for requests per second (RPS). For usage
      guidelines, see Rate balancing mode and Utilization balancing mode. Not
      available if the backend's balancingMode is CONNECTION.
    type: number
  maxUtilization:
    description: |-
      Optional parameter to define a target capacity for the UTILIZATION
      balancing mode. The valid range is [0.0, 1.0]. For usage guidelines, see
      Utilization balancing mode.
    type: number
  preference:
    description: |-
      This field indicates whether this backend should be fully utilized before
      sending traffic to backends with default preference. The possible values
      are: 1) DEFAULT:  If preferred backends don't have enough capacity, backends in this layer
      would be used and traffic would be assigned based on the load balancing algorithm you use.
      This is the default. 2) PREFERRED: Backends with this preference level will be filled up to
      their capacity limits first, based on RTT.
    type: string
    enum:
    - DEFAULT
    - PREFERENCE_UNSPECIFIED
    - PREFERRED
