## 413.0.0 (2023-01-10)

### Breaking Changes

*   **(Cloud Storage)** Added `--fetch-encrypted-object-hashes` flag to `ls` and `objects list` commands. API requests to the LIST endpoint do not fetch the hashes for encrypted objects by default. If this flag is set, a GET request is sent for each encrypted object in order to fetch hashes. This can significantly increase the cost of the commands.
  * Previously, the fallback to GET was implemented for CSEK-encrypted objects as the default behavior. With this flag, both CSEK and CMEK are handled, and `gcloud` CLI checks if it has the necessary CSEK key before sending a GET request.
*   **(Kubernetes Engine)** This change starts using the Client-Go Credential Plugin `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` as noted in [Client-go Credential Plugin changes](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke).


### Google Cloud CLI

* Fixed a crash during reauth when Enterprise Certificate is used.
* Fixed issue where the `gcloud` CLI would crash when invoked in PowerShell 7.3.
  This issue was reported at:
  <https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/259295558>.
* Added `core/default_format` and `core/format` properties to config in order
  enable setting a default print format. Print format is first determined by
  global flag `--format`. If `--format` flag is not defined, then CLI defaults
  to `core/format` value. If `core/format` is not defined, then CLI defaults to
  command specific output. If command specific output is undefined, then format
  is determined by `core/default_format`. `core/default_format` defaults to yaml
  format.

### AI

* Modified `--region` flag of `gcloud ai model-monitoring-jobs` to include new
model monitoring jobs regions.
* Modified `--explanation-metadata-file` flag of `gcloud ai models upload` from required to optional.

    `gcloud container aws node-pools update` to update the collection of
    specific CloudWatch metrics for the autoscaling group of AWS node pools.
*   Added `--clear-autoscaling-metrics` flag to
    `gcloud container aws node-pools update` to clear the CloudWatch metrics
    collection associated with the autoscaling group of AWS node pools.
*   Added `gcloud container attached operations list` to show the underlying
    action (create, update, delete, etc) associated with Attached clusters
    long-running operations.
*   Added `gcloud container attached operations describe` to show detailed
    status of a provided Attached clusters long-running operation.
*   Added `gcloud container attached operations wait` to wait for completion of

  * Note that the gcloud command-line tool does not currently support connecting
    to proxies via HTTPS (nor did it previously).
  * If attempting to connect to an HTTP proxy results in warnings or errors,
    ensure that the `https_proxy` environment variable looks like `http://...`
    as opposed to `https://...`.

    commands to use separate flags for organization and location.


### App Engine

* Added `gcloud beta app services update` to allow management of incoming
  traffic to an app on a per-service basis.
* Promoted `--no-cache` flag of `gcloud app deploy` to GA. This flag disables
  the build cache when deploying an app.

  disable call will proceed even if there are enabled services which depend on
  the service to be disabled. Forcing the call means that the services which
  depend on the service to be disabled will also be disabled.



### Compute Engine

   `object.finalize` event on file creation. To get the legacy behavior, use the
   `--trigger-event` and `--trigger-resource` flags  e.g.
   gcloud functions deploy --trigger-event \
   providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change \
   --trigger-resource <your_bucket_name>
* **(MODIFIED)** The schema for Pub/Sub events has changed. `eventId`,
  `timestamp`, `resource`, and `eventType` have all been moved inside the
  context property e.g., context.timestamp. All functions deployed using
  `--trigger-topic` flag will use the new schema. To get the legacy behavior,
  use the `--trigger-event` and `--trigger-resource` flags e.g.
  gcloud functions deploy --trigger-event \
  providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish \
  --trigger-resource <your_topic_name>
* Please see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications for more
  information on storage event types.

* Promoted `gcloud sql export` to GA.
* Promoted `gcloud sql import` to GA.
* Added warnings when calling `gcloud sql instances create` with both the
  `--region` and `--gce-zone` flags, or with neither. These flags will become
  mutually exclusive, with exactly one being required for create calls.

### Breaking Changes

* The `--class` and `--jar` flags for the `hadoop` and `spark` commands in
  `gcloud dataproc jobs submit` are now mutually exclusive. The previous usage
  had been deprecated for more than a year.
*  **(MODIFIED)** Soon changing the default event schema returned by Cloud
   Functions with a Pub/Sub trigger(e.g. `--trigger-topic`). The `eventId`,
   `timestamp`, `eventType`, and `resource` properties will all be moved into
   the `event.context` property.
   *   To opt-in to the new behavior early, run
       `gcloud config set functions/use_new_pubsub_trigger True`.
   *   To restore old behavior, run
       `gcloud config set functions/use_new_pubsub_trigger False` or use
       the `--trigger-event` flag e.g. `gcloud functions deploy --trigger-
       event providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish \
       --trigger-resource <TOPIC_NAME>`
   *   Please see
       https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/writing/background#event_parameter
       for more information on the new schema.
* In alpha and beta:
  * Removed `iot configs` and `iot credentials` command groups. Please use
    `iot devices configs` and `iot devices credentials` instead.
  * Removed the `--enable-device` flag from `iot devices create` and
    `iot devices update`. Please use `--blocked` instead.
  * Removed the `--pubsub-topic` flag and deprecated the `--event-pubsub-topic`
    flag from `iot registries create` and `iot registries update`. Please use the
    `--event-notification-config` flag instead.
*  **(REMOVED)** Removed `NAME` and `--regexp` args from
   `compute target-ssl-proxies list`. Please use the `--filter` flag instead.
* Added the `container/use_v1_api` property, which replaces the
  `container/use_v1_api_client` property. If true, all gcloud Kubernetes Engine
  commands (regardless of release track) will use the v1 API; otherwise,
  gcloud beta track commands will use v1beta1 API and gcloud alpha track
  commands will use v1alpha1 API. By default, it is set to true. The default
  will be changed to false by the end of March.

### Firebase Test Lab

* Added default`as a possible device orientation. When orientation is
  `default`, the most appropriate orientation for your app is picked.
   Usually, this is any app-specified orientation for the main activity or
  `portrait`, if none is specified in the app manifest.

### Identity and Access Management

*   **(MODIFIED)** Promoted `gcloud beta iam roles`,
    `gcloud beta iam list-testable-permissions` to GA.

    `gcloud beta iam roles create`, `gcloud beta iam roles update`, and
    `gcloud beta iam roles copy` commands when using permissions with `TESTING`
    `customRolesSupportLevel`. The prompt needs to be answered to finish the
    request. Specify `--quiet` to prevent prompting confirming intent.


### Cloud Datalab

* Updated the `datalab` component to the 20180119 release.

  Released changes are documented in its tracking issue at
  [https://github.com/googledatalab/datalab/issues/1921](https://github.com/googledatalab/datalab/issues/1921).

### Cloud Datastore Emulator

*   Released Cloud Datastore Emulator version 1.4.0.
    *   The emulator now returns error codes that match the Cloud Datastore
        service for two scenarios: inserts of entities that already exist and
        updates to ones that don't.

### Cloud Functions

* Modified behaviour of `gcloud beta functions deploy` when
  re-deploying existing function without --source flag. `beta functions deploy`
  will now always upload source code (whether or not --source flag is supplied)
  from current directory if function was previously deployed from local source.

### Cloud SDK

### Breaking Changes

* (REMOVED) Removed `gcloud ml-engine init-project`. This step is now performed
  automatically.
* Removed `--discard-local-ssd` flag from `gcloud compute instances stop`
  (beta and GA). This flag wasn't working as intended. Stopping an instance
  that uses a local SSD is not currently supported; delete and recreate the
  instance instead.
* (DEPRECATED) Deprecated the `gcloud container` `--[no-]enable-cloud-endpoints`
  flag (removed in alpha and beta).
* (MODIFIED) Added the `gcloud container` `container/new_scopes_behavior`
  property, which will, in a future release, be the default behavior. If set
  to true, `compute-rw`, `devstorage-ro`, `service-control`, and
  `service-management` scopes are no longer added to what is specified in
  `--scopes`, `compute-rw` is no longer included in the default scopes, and
  `--[no-]enable-cloud-endpoints` flags are not allowed. This is now the
  default behavior for alpha and beta, so this property has no effect for
  those tracks.

  created with a node version
  different from that of the master, via the `--node-version` flag.

### Container Registry

* Updated `docker-credential-gcr` to v1.4.2:
  * Refreshes the cloud SDK's access token when retrieving it, when configured
    to use `gcloud` as a token source.


## 183.0.0 (2017-12-13)

### Breaking Changes

    * Fixed issue in `gcloud container [clusters|node-pools] create` where, if
      --scopes included cloud endpoints scopes and --no-enable-cloud-endpoints
      was also specified, the cloud endpoints scopes were still included.  They
      are now filtered out.
* **(MODIFIED)** Modified `gcloud alpha deployment-manager deployments
  <create|update|describe>` and `gcloud alpha deployment-manager resources list`
  commands to show the 'RUNTIME_POLICIES' instead of 'INTENT' of the resources
  under deployment that have not been previewed.

    longer needed by other Google Cloud ML Engine commands.

### Google Cloud SDK

*   GA cmdlets for Stackdriver Logging, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud IAM
    are now available in Cloud Tools for PowerShell.

### Google App Engine

*   `gcloud beta app deploy` now uses the new PHP Runtime Builder pipeline to
    deploy apps. The normal `gcloud app deploy` remains unchanged.
*   Previously, `gcloud app` list commands would only show the first 50 results.
    Now, all relevant results will be shown.

### Google Compute Engine

*   It is now supported to delete both zonal and regional Managed Instance
    Groups in one `gcloud` invocation.
*   Using labels in `gcloud` for the following Google Compute Engine resources
    is now in GA: disks, images, instances, and snapshots.

### Google Cloud Container Builder

*   Added `--no-launch-browser` flag to all `gcloud app browse` commands:
    *   Allows the user to specify that they don't want a browser, they just
        want the url.
    *   Detects situations that the user probably can't launch a browser (no
        DISPLAY, etc.) and just prints the URL instead of attempting to launch
        a browser.

### Google Cloud Bigtable

*   `cbt ls <table>` now shows the GC policy for each column family.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Added `gcloud compute instances set-service-account`

## 158.0.0 (2017-06-07)

### Breaking Changes

*   The App Engine Go externalized runtime will detect Go apps using only the
    files in the root of the app directory. This means that
    `gcloud beta app gen-config` (and `gcloud app deploy` in an app directory
    with no app.yaml file) will not recognize a Go runtime if .go files are in
    subdirectories. To override this behavior, run
    `gcloud beta app gen-config --runtime go` to generate an app.yaml with the
    Go runtime.

### Google App Engine

*   `gcloud beta app deploy` now uses the new Ruby Runtime Builder pipeline to
     deploy apps. The normal `gcloud app deploy` remains unchanged.

      being updated, unless the `--authorized-networks` flag is being used.

### Google Compute Engine

*     POTENTIALLY BREAKING: Most `gcloud compute` commands that involve
      specifying instances will now only prompt with relevant zones and no
      longer show all Google Cloud Platform zones when the `--zone` flag is
      omitted.
*     gcloud shared VPC network (XPN) commands are now in GA.

## 157.0.0 (2017-05-31)

### Google Cloud SDK

*   Added the auth/disable_credentials property that allows gcloud to
    make requests without loading credentials. This is only useful if you are
    behind a proxy that adds authentication to your requests automatically.
*   Cloud Tools for PowerShell:
    *   Added BigQuery beta cmdlets to manage BigQuery datasets.
    *   Added Container beta cmdlets to manage Container clusters.

*   Updated the `datalab` component to the 20170525 release. Changes in this
    release are documented in its tracking issue
    [here](https://github.com/googledatalab/datalab/issues/1385).

### Google Cloud Container Engine

*   Updated Google Container Engine's kubectl from version 1.6.3 to 1.6.4.

### Google Cloud ML Engine

*   Removed `gcloud beta ml` alias for `gcloud beta ml-engine`
    commands. Please use `gcloud ml-engine` directly.
*   Removed `gcloud ml-engine models versions` group in favor of the identical
    `gcloud ml-engine versions` group.
*   `gcloud ml-engine` commands in the beta track now run
    against the `v1` API, since the `v1beta1` API is turning down.
    These changes do not affect `gcloud ml` commands for Google Cloud Natural
    Language, Google Cloud Speech, or Google Cloud Vision.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Promoted `gcloud sql connect` to GA.

### Google Cloud KMS

*   Added `encrypt` and `decrypt` commands to `gcloud beta kms`.

## 156.0.0 (2017-05-24)

### Breaking Changes

*   `gcloud container builds submit` will host build logs in a bucket owned
    by the Container Builder team by default, rather than one owned by the
    customer. If the customer does specify a bucket,
    The command `gcloud container builds submit` will no longer create that
    bucket if it does not already exist.

*   `gcloud sql instances set-root-password` is now deprecated and will be
    removed in version 162.0.0. Please use `gcloud sql users set-password`
    as an alternative.

*   `gcloud computes copy-files` is now deprecated. Use `gcloud compute scp`
    instead. Note that recursive copy is not turned on by default for `scp`.
    Add `--recurse` to the invocation to turn it on.

*   The ISO time string format for the `DUE_TIME` argument to retrieve a backup
    in `gcloud beta sql backups describe` is now deprecated in favor of
    integer format (now known as the `ID` argument). Instead of running:

    $ gcloud beta sql backups describe 2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z --instance a1

    please run:

    $ gcloud beta sql backups describe 1490238000769 --instance a1

### Google App Engine

    instead of `nsenter` in order to attach to container. The `--container`
    flag can be used with any VM instance that has docker installed.

*   Promoted Identity-Aware Proxy support to the GA release track for
    `gcloud compute backend-services`.

*   Add the `suse-sap-cloud` project to the default public image list.

    `--wait`.

*   Moved `gcloud container operations cancel` to beta.

*   Moved `gcloud container node-pools rollback` to beta.

*   Added ability to specify `--labels` when creating a Container Engine cluster
    in gcloud alpha or beta. These labels can be changed by using the
    `--update-labels` or `--remove-labels` flags now available in `gcloud

    information see `gcloud beta compute target-tcp-proxies` group and the
    online documentation:
    *   https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/tcp-ssl/tcp-proxy

### Google Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create|get-credentials` will now configure
    kubectl to use the credentials of the active gcloud account by default,
    instead of using application default credentials. This requires kubectl
    1.6.0 or higher. You can update kubectl by running
    `gcloud components update kubectl`.
    If you prefer to use application default credentials to authenticate kubectl
    to Google Container Engine clusters, you can revert to the previous behavior
    by setting the `container/use_application_default_credentials` property:
    *   `gcloud config set container/use_application_default_credentials true`
    *   `export CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_USE_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS=true`
*   Added `--[no-]enable-legacy-abac` option to

### Google Cloud IAM

*   Added tab completion to `gcloud iam service-accounts` commands.

### Google Cloud Logging

*   Removed deprecated "unique-writer-identity" flag. All created/updated sinks
    will use custom service accounts to increase security.
    Please see documentation for more details:
    *   https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#dest-auth
*   Remove support for creating/updating sinks with legacy V1 format.

### Google Cloud Resource Manager

*   Updated `gcloud projects set-iam-policy` and
    `gcloud organizations set-iam-policy` commands to allow users to edit audit
    configs. Changes to IAM policy should be handled via a read-modify-write
    command sequence.

### Google Cloud Storage

*   Update gsutil component to 4.24.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Added `gcloud beta sql instances set-root-password` for consistency with
    the GA set of commands.
    This command is deprecated in favor of `gcloud beta sql users set-password`.

### Google Cloud Source Repositories

*   `gcloud source repos` command group promoted to Beta track.

### Emulators

*   Datastore emulator now defaults to port 8081, and Pub/Sub emulator to 8085.


## 149.0.0 (2017-03-29)

### Breaking Changes

*   The Cloud SDK installer on `*nix` will no longer attempt to update your RC
    files in non-interactive mode.
*   Support for creating/updating legacy sinks has been removed from
    `gcloud beta logging`.

### Cloud SDK

*   SHA256 checksums, instead of SHA1 checksums, are now being published for
    Cloud SDK versioned archives and other downloadable assets.

### Firebase Test Lab

*   The `gcloud test` commands have been promoted to GA and renamed
    `gcloud firebase test ...`.  All `gcloud beta test ...` commands are
    deprecated.
*   The preferred way to specify test devices is the new `--device` argument,
    which allows more precise control over which device dimensions are included
    in a test matrix. See `gcloud firebase test android run --help` and
    `gcloud topic arg-files` for details.

### Google App Engine

*   Updated Python SDK to version 1.9.51.
*   Support Server Name Indication (SNI) for remote API shell.

### Google Cloud Datalab

*   Update the datalab component to the 20170323 build. With this release, the
    entire `/content` directory of newly created instances will be persisted to
    the attached disk rather than just the `/content/datalab` directory.

### Google Cloud Natural Language

*   The `gcloud beta ml language` command group is now available. Use commands
    in this group to analyze text with the Natural Language API. For more
    information, see: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/.

*   The optional flag `--values` has been added to
    `gcloud beta runtime-config configs variables list`; it can be used to
    return values along with variables.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Argument validation for instance arguments has been added to
   `gcloud beta sql instances create`, `gcloud sql instances create`, and
   `gcloud sql instances set-root-password`

### Google Compute Engine

*   `gcloud alpha compute ssh` can now connect to instances using private IP
    addresses.
*   `gcloud alpha compute images create` now has a `--force-creation` flag.

### Google Container Engine

*   `gcloud container images delete` has been modified to delete the underlying
    image, and all associated tags, when given a tag reference. For the
    remainder of beta, `--resolve-tag-to-digest` will be required when deleting
    an image by tag, to avoid accidental deletion. This will become default
    behavior when the command graduates from beta.


## 148.0.1 (2017-03-24)

### Google Cloud Functions

*   Fixed a bug where `gcloud beta functions deploy` did not work without the
    `--region` flag specified.


## 148.0.0 (2017-03-22)

### Breaking Changes

*   The `gcloud ml-engine jobs submit training`
    command is now asynchronous by default; pass `--stream-logs` to get the
    old behavior.
*   `gcloud ml-engine local predict` now only supports
    prediction using models in SavedModel format. For details, see:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/README.md

### Cloud SDK

*   Windows users upgrading to the new version might see an error after
    running `gcloud components update`. This is because the update modifies
    the gcloud.cmd file. The update should have finished successfully
    regardless of the error. To make sure, run `gcloud components update`
    again. It should say it's already up to date.

### Google Cloud BigQuery

*   Added support for updating field descriptions on query destination table.
    See the `destination_schema` flag within the `query` command.
*   Added support for showing only a subset of selected table fields.
    See the `selected_fields` flag within the `head` command.
*   Added support for setting labels on tables.
    See the `label` flag within the `mk` command.

### Google Cloud Datalab

*   Updated the datalab component to the 20170316 build.
    This release includes two bug fixes in how the tool looks up
    Datalab instances:

    1. No longer prompt for a zone if the specified instance does not exist.
    2. Report an error if the specified instance was not created by the tool.

### Deployment Manager

*   Promote `gcloud alpha deployment-manager` commands to the beta
    release track.

### Google Cloud ML Engine

*   The default log polling interval for logs has been raised;
    this should prevent streaming from using too much quota.

### Google Container Engine

*   Update Google Container Engine's kubectl from version 1.5.3 to 1.5.4.

### Google Container Registry

*   `untag` has been added to the `container images` command group. In the
    future, `container images delete` will be modified to delete the underlying
    image (and all associated tags) and this will be the primary method of
    removing tags from images.

### Google Service Management

*   `--validate-only` flag added to `service-management deploy` command

### Google Cloud Key Management Service

*   `gcloud beta kms` commands have been promoted to general availability
     as `gcloud kms`.

### Google Cloud Storage

*   Promote `compute backend-buckets` commands to general availability.
*   Update gsutil component to 4.23


## 147.0.0 (2017-03-15)

### Breaking Changes

*   Modified argument parsing for commands that pass arguments through to
    another program.
    The `--` argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
    left and the rest of the command on the right.
    Commands will no longer allow the omission of the `--`, and unparsed
    arguments will not be treated as implementation args.
*   Made the `--config-name` flag mandatory for
    `runtime-config configs variables` and `runtime-config configs waiters`
    commands.
*   Renamed `gcloud kms cryptokeys` as `gcloud kms keys`.
    Renamed the `--cryptokey` flag as `--key`.
    Deprecated the `cryptokey` variants.
*   Modified `alpha source repos clone` to produce an error message if the
    repository being cloned is a mirror. The command no longer asks to create
    the repo if it does not exist.

### Cloud SDK

*   The gcloud interactive shell auto completes gcloud commands and flags, and
    displays help, as command lines are typed into the shell.
    Run `gcloud alpha shell` to launch the shell.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Promoted custom cache keys to beta.
*   Promoted `gcloud compute networks subnets` to beta.

### Google App Engine

*   Modified Google App Engine Flexible Environment runtimes that
    require `entrypoint:` to automatically prepend `exec` to
    entrypoints, to ensure signals are passed through to the application
    process.
*   Java SDK updated to 1.9.50. For more details, please see
    *   https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/release-notes

### Google Cloud Bigtable

*   Updated binaries for the `cbt` commandline tool to allow for creation of
    tables with initial splits.

### Google Cloud Datalab

    that only updates the name of the project from which we fetch the
    Container OS images to the new `cos-cloud` project.

### Google Container Engine

*   Added `--enable-autorepair` flag to
    `gcloud beta container clusters create` and
    `gcloud beta container node-pools create`.

### Google Cloud Resource Manager

*   Promoted the `gcloud projects create` command to GA.

### Google Cloud Vision

*   The `gcloud beta ml vision` command group is now available. These commands
    allow you to analyze images with Google Cloud Vision:

    * `gcloud beta ml vision detect-documents`
    * `gcloud beta ml vision detect-faces`
    * `gcloud beta ml vision detect-image-properties`
    * `gcloud beta ml vision detect-labels`
    * `gcloud beta ml vision detect-landmarks`
    * `gcloud beta ml vision detect-logos`

     being run from inside of Google Cloud Shell, and do not attempt to
     launch the browser in those cases.
  4. The tool will now detect and warn if two users try to share a single
     Datalab instance, as that use case is not supported.
  5. Newly created Datalab instances use the Container Optimized OS
     rather than the older Container VM OS.

* Added `gcloud alpha compute url-maps list-cache-invalidations` command.

### Google App Engine

* Google App Engine components updated to 1.9.31. Please visit the following
  release notes for details:
  Python - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/release-notes
  Java - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/release-notes

* Added `--runtime` flag to `gcloud preview app gen-config` to specify a runtime
  when a directory identifies as multiple runtimes. This flag can be used in
  conjunction with `--custom`.

### Google Container Engine

* `gcloud container cluster describe` and `list` commands now notify the user
  when their cluster versions are about to go out of support or are unsupported.

### Google Cloud Logging

* `gcloud beta logging write` and `gcloud beta logging logs delete` commands now
  use the V2beta1 API. The `gcloud beta logging write` command now uses the
  global resource descriptor (which translates to "custom.googleapis.com"
  service in V1).

### Cloud Dataproc

* `gcloud beta dataproc clusters create` now supports `--tags` and `--metadata`
  flags to set instance tags and metadata on all instances in the Dataproc
  cluster.

### Pub/Sub Emulator

* A new --host flag can be used to specify the address the emulator should bind
  as. The flag can be left unspecified, set to "localhost", a hostname, or an
  explicit IP address.

### Projects

* Added commands `get-iam-policy`, `set-iam-policy`, `add-iam-policy-binding`,
  and `remove-iam-policy-binding` for the `gcloud beta projects` surface.

* Added the `gcloud projects list` command that can be used to list projects.

## 93.0.0 (2016-1-20)

* kubectrl upgraded to 1.1.4.

* `gcloud beta dataproc cluster create` now supports `--properties` flag to set
  properties for installed packages.

* Datastore emulator's `DATASTORE_LOCAL_HOST` environment variable changed to
  `DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST`.

* `gcloud source repos clone` now supports `--dry-run` flag to show equivalent
  git command.

## 92.0.0 (2016-1-13)

*   Because of the rollback of 91.0.0, this release contains all of the changes
    from 91.0.0 in addition to the changes listed below.

### Breaking Changes

*   `gcloud preview app deploy`

    *   Changed deployments to set the deployed versions to receive all traffic
        for their modules by default.

        To keep the old behavior (traffic split remains the same), use the
        `--no-promote` flag or run
        `gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true`.

        Note that your old versions are still running, and must be stopped
        manually. This behavior will change in a future release.

    *   Removed deprecated `--set-default` flag.  Please use `--promote`
        instead.

    *   `gcloud preview app deploy`: Removed deprecated `--env-vars` flag.

*   The output of the `gcloud preview app modules list` command has been
    changed to include the traffic split percentage instead of the 'default
    version' field.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules cancel-deployment` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules download` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app run` command. Please use
    `dev_appserver.py` instead.

*   Changed behavior of the `--zone`/`-z` flag in the `gcloud dns record-sets`
    command group. This flag can no longer precede the command. For instance,
    `gcloud dns record-sets -z=mz list` will not work, but
    `gcloud dns record-sets list -z=mz` will.

*   Changed `--password-file` option for `sql instances set-root-password`;
    password now does not include trailing newline from password file. This
    matches the documented behavior, but not the previous behavior.
    (Fixes https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906498)

*   Removed `meta/active_configuration` from the results of `gcloud config list`
    since it is not a property that can be set. You can continue to use the
    `gcloud config configurations` commands to view and manage your
    configurations.

### Cloud SDK

*   Added `gcloud config` proxy settings. Users can configure `gcloud` to use a
    proxy via the following settings:

    *   `gcloud config proxy/address`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/password`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/port`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/type`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/username`

*   Added `alpha` and `beta` components to Debian packages.

*   Removed unused config properties: `app/hosted_registry`, `app/host`,
   `app/admin_host`, `app/api_host`.

### Google Cloud Logging

*   Migrated to
    [v2beta1](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/introduction_v2) API
    release.

    *   Moved `gcloud beta logging sinks` commands to `v2beta1`.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging resource-descriptors` command to display
        supported resources from various services.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging read` command to retrieve log entries using
        filters.

### Google Container Engine

*   Added `gcloud container clusters resize` for resizing Container Engine
    clusters.

*   Added notifications when node upgrades are available to `gcloud container
    cluster describe` and `list` commands.

### Google App Engine

*   Fixed bug where initial deployments using `--image-url` failed.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules set_default` command to use the App
    Engine Admin API.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules list` command to use the App Engine
    Admin API.


## 91.0.1 (2015-12-16)

* The Cloud SDK has been rolled back to 90.0.0.

## 91.0.0 (2015-12-16)

### Breaking Changes

* Deprecated command group `gcloud compute replica-pools` has been removed.
* Deprecated command group `gcloud compute resource-views` has been removed.
* App Engine API is now the only supported method for deploying in the
  `gcloud preview app deploy` command.

### Google App Engine

* `DEPLOYABLES` argument for `gcloud preview app deploy` is now optional. If not
   given, the command defaults to `app.yaml` in the current directory; if that
   is not found, it attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration
   files (such as app.yaml) in the current directory before deployment.
*  `--force` argument to `gcloud preview app deploy` is now deprecated and will
   be removed in a future release.

### Container

* `gcloud container` commands that poll long running operations (e.g create,
   delete, upgrade) now display progress details when available.


## 90.0.0 (2015-12-09)

* Cloud SDK release version scheme has changed. Patch version is now treated as
  a major release version which corresponds to SDK weekly releases.
  Any updates/fixes to released version will increment minor/patch version
  number going forward.

### Breaking Changes

* The deprecated flag --clear-target-pool has been removed from
  `gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-target-pools` command.

### Google App Engine

* Components updated to 1.9.30.
  Please visit the following release notes for details:
  * Python - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/release-notes
  * Java - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/release-notes
* Fixed a bug caused by uploading invalid file names for vm: true applications.

### Compute

* Subnetwork support has been promoted from alpha to beta. For more information
  see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks.


## 0.9.89 (2015-12-02)

### Breaking Changes

*   Removed flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` for `gcloud container clusters create`;
    please use `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` instead.

*   Renamed `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create --ike-networks` to
    `--local-traffic-selector`.

*   `gcloud alpha compute resource-views` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` commands instead.

*   `gcloud alpha compute replica-pools` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands instead.

### `gcloud` Core

*   Changed behavior of `gcloud init` git repository clone option. It now takes
    as input a path to the destination directory for the repository,
    rather than the parent directory of the repository destination.

### BigQuery

*   Fixed failure in `gcloud alpha bq query "select * from ..."` command
    while displaying query results.

### Compute

*   Fixed `gcloud alpha compute instances set-machine-type` failure when
    supplying custom cpu/custom memory, but no zone.

*   Added a new scope alias for Cloud Monitoring: `monitoring-write`. This scope
    is on by default in all new VMs.

### Google Cloud DNS

*   Added `--replace-origin-ns` flag to `gcloud dns record-sets import` command
    to allow importing NS records.

### Google Cloud Storage

*   Updated `gsutil` component to 4.16.

### Google Container Engine

*   Updated kubectl to version 1.1.2.

*   Increased `gcloud container clusters create/delete` timeouts from 20m to
    30m.

*   Added `--subnetwork` flag to `gcloud container clusters create` to allow
    creation of container clusters can now be created in a Google Compute Engine
    subnetwork (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks).


## 0.9.88 (2015-11-25)

### Breaking Changes

* The `gcloud preview app run` command has now been removed. Please use the
  bundled `dev_appserver.py` script directly instead.

* App Engine: The 'version' and 'application' fields in module and configuration
  files are now illegal. Project name should instead be specified either by
  `gcloud config set project MY_PROJECT` or by setting the `--project` flag on
  individual command executions. Versions are generated automatically by default
  but can also be manually specified by setting the `--version` flag on
  individual command executions.

### App Engine

* Don't do runtime identification for custom runtimes during deploy. This fixes
  issue [#387](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906466).

* The `dev_appserver.py` script no longer requires the installation of all App
  Engine components. It will install only the necessary ones at run time.
  Fixes [#273](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906352)

### Core

* Added the `gcloud components install` command.  This allows you to install
  missing components at the version of the SDK you currently have (it does not
  update your SDK installation).  `gcloud components update` should now only be
  used to update your SDK to the latest version.

* Fixes [#293](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906372) related SSL
  certificate validation issues.

* Use zsh builtins in path.zsh.inc for faster/cleaner shell startup.

## 0.9.87 (2015-11-18)

### Compute

* `gcloud alpha compute instances create` now supports --custom-cpu and
   --custom-memory flags to specify custom machine types.

### Dataproc

* Added `gcloud beta dataproc clusters diagnose` command. See
  <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/support/diagnose-command> for more info.

### Google Container Engine

* Updated kubectl to version 1.1.1.

## 0.9.86 (2015-11-11)

### App Engine

* Generated node.js Dockerfiles now add the full application context before
  running install hooks.

* For Google App Engine Node.js runtimes, install requested version of node
  prior to doing an npm install.

### Compute

* `gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type` has been promoted from alpha
  to beta,

## 0.9.85 (2015-11-04)

### Breaking Changes

* `gcloud alpha compute networks create` now requires --mode flag.

### App Engine

* Added the --output-directory option to gen-repo-info-file command. This option
  supersedes --output-file, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.

* Improved error message when specified yaml file is not found.

### Compute

* Launching `gcloud alpha compute networks subnets`.

* `gcloud compute alpha instance-templates` and `instances` now support
  subnetworks.

* New flag --ike-networks in `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create`.

* `gcloud compute ssh` now passes through the exit code of the ssh command. This
  fixes issue [#146](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906227).

### Misc. Changes

* Gracefully handle socket timeouts while checking for Google Compute Engine
  metadata server. This fixes issue
  [#339](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906418).

## 0.9.84 (2015-10-28)

### App Engine

* Due to PageSpeed service deprecation, user will receive a warning when
  deploying a new version to App Engine.

* Implemented fingerprinting support for Java.

* The gen-config flag now generates only app.yaml for the matching runtime by
  default, you must use the --custom flag to generate an app.yaml with a runtime
  of "custom" and Dockerfile (and other configs).

### Compute

* GA support for HTTPS load balancing features.

* Deprecated --clear-target-pool flag from compute instance-groups managed
  set-target-pools command.

### Windows support

* Windows Installer can now take a /logtofile flag to write installation logs to
  file CloudSDKInstall.log located in the same directory.

* Windows installer now displays an error message when the installation
  does not succeed.

### Command Line Interface support

* The [page=N] table format attribute prints one or more tables of at most N
  rows. Use this to view paged server data as it arrives at the client.

## 0.9.83 (2015-10-21)

### App Engine

* In a future release, the `gcloud preview app deploy` command will no longer
  support deploying multiple modules in the same invocation.

### Compute

* Ubuntu 14.10 is end of life: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

* Fixed external issue [#291](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906370),
  related to handling network addresses on Windows.

### Container Engine

* `gcloud container clusters list` now displays the current number of nodes
  for the cluster.

### Windows support

* When running Cloud SDK tools from PowerShell the `gcloud-ps.ps1` wrapper
  scripts now can be used which no longer call to `cmd.exe`. Using `gcloud-ps`,
  complex arguments can be passed without escaping for Windows command line.
  Using `gcloud`, the following command would be correctly escaped when running
  gcloud in PowerShell:

    gcloud fun --arg='"test ^< 123"'

  With the new `gcloud-ps`, the same command can be simply written as:

    gcloud-ps fun --arg='test < 123'

  Permissions to run PowerShell scripts must be given to PowerShell before these
  will work. Permissions can be changed with
  `"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"`.

## 0.9.82 (2015-10-14)

### App Engine

*   The App Engine Admin API is now the default path for deployments in the
    `gcloud preview app deploy` command. This transition should be transparent,
    but if you experience any issues and would like to revert to the old
    behavior, please run `gcloud config set app/use_appengine_api false`.

    See <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/admin-api/> for more
    information about this API.

*   With `env: 2`, valid python runtimes are `python` and `python-compat`.

*   Implemented fingerprinting support for python.

### Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create`: The flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` has
    been deprecated; `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` should be used instead.

### SQL

*   `gcloud beta sql operations describe` and `gcloud beta sql operations wait`
    no longer need `--instance` flag (`gcloud beta sql operations list` still
    does).

*   Fixed issue with `gcloud sql instances clone` when `--bin-log-file-name` and
    `--bin-log-position` are set.
    (<https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906280>).

## 0.9.81 (2015-10-07)

### Breaking Changes

*   If you are using a service account to run commands under
    `gcloud preview app`, you must enable the "App Engine Admin API" in the
    Developers Console (<https://console.developers.google.com>; navigate to
    **APIs and Auth > APIs**).

*   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version to
    receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.

    To keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version`
    flag, or run the following command:

       $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version false

*   Removed `app get-resource-limits` command.

### App Engine

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.27. Please see the following release
    notes for details:
    *   Python: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/release-notes>
    *   Java: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/release-notes>
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now requires that users specify or
    omit the runtime: field from app.yaml if a Dockerfile is also specified.
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now supports the "engines" field in
    package.json for node.js applications.

### Misc. Changes

*   Windows Installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the installation
  finishes.

## 0.9.80 (2015-09-30)

*   `gcloud app`
    *   Soon, deployments will set the deployed version to receive all traffic
        by default.  To keep the current behavior, use the `--no-promote` flag
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

        To adopt the new behavior early, use the `--promote` flag or run the
        following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true

    *   The `--set-default` flag is deprecated. Please use the `--promote` flag
        instead.
    *   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version
        to receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.  To
        keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version` flag,
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version true

    *   The `app run` command is deprecated and will soon be removed.  Please
        use dev_appserver (found in the same directory as the `gcloud command)
        instead.
    *   The `gcloud preview app modules download command` is deprecated, and
        will be removed soon.

*   The Windows installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the
    installation finishes.
*   The `preview` component has been removed.
    *   The `gcloud preview app` commands remain available as usual and
        are still shipped through the `app` component.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` instead
        of `gcloud preview instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups managed` instead of
        `gcloud preview managed-instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
*   All Google Compute User Accounts commands have moved to beta.
*   Deployment-manager list commands now support pagination.
*   Minor bug fixes.

## 0.9.79 (2015-09-23)

*   The following commands have been promoted from beta to GA:
    *   gcloud config configurations ...
    *   gcloud source repos clone
    *   gcloud beta init. Old `gcloud init` behavior has been removed, and
        partially replaced by new gcloud init or directly via gcloud source
        repos clone.
*   Release gcloud beta dataproc.
*   The --env-vars flag in gcloud preview app deploy has been removed.
*   Automatic ssh key generation respects the --quiet flag.
*   The --format flag now supports extended format expressions. For details run
    $ gcloud topic formats.
*   Most commands now document the positive Boolean --FLAG form and accept
    --no-FLAG to disable. For the past few releases --log-http accepted an
    optional true/false value. It has been restored to its original definition
    of being a Boolean flag that has no value.
*   `gcloud sql` operations are now automatically retried for 2s in case of
    HttpException: The Cloud SQL instance operation does not exist.
*   Update gcloud's kubectl from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6.
*   Deprecate `gcloud preview app get-resource-limits`.

## 0.9.78 (2015-09-16)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.26.
*   Increase the default boot disk size for remote build VMs in
    `gcloud preview app deploy`.
*   The `--instance` flag to the `gcloud preview app modules set-managed-by`
    command now takes an instance name instead of an index.
*   The V1Beta4 API for sqladmin can now be accessed through the
    `gcloud beta sql` surface.
*   Usability enhancements for `gcloud beta init` and named configurations.

## 0.9.77 (2015-09-09)

*   gcloud preview logging is now gcloud beta logging.
*   Update kubectl to version 1.0.5
*   Windows Cloud SDK installer improvements:
    *   Now allows changing the installation mode. You can choose between a
        "current user" installation and an "all users" installation.
    *   Now has an uninstaller and writes "Add/Remove Programs" uninstall
        entries.
*   Removal of unsupported --env-vars argument from gcloud preview app deploy.
*   gcloud compute instance groups: Allow --named-ports flag to be empty and
    clean named ports in set-named-ports commands.
*   Change in gcloud compute backend-services: introduce new flag
    --instance-group which takes advantage of new Instance Groups API.

## 0.9.76 (2015-09-02)

*   Update gsutil component to 4.14.
*   Resource views commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute resource-views` in place of `gcloud preview resource-views`.
*   Replica pool commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute replica-pools` in place of `gcloud preview replica-pools`.
*   `gcloud beta source repo` was renamed to `gcloud beta source repos`
*   Created google-cloud-sdk-announce@googlegroups.com
    <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/google-cloud-sdk-announce> email group to
    announce new releases and other important information.
*   'gcloud alpha init' command is now also in beta.
*   Add target size of managed instance group for "compute instance-groups
    managed list" command.
*   Fixed the removal of platform-specific components when running `gcloud

    root (like on Debian Compute Engine images).
    *   Affected users should now see less frequent update messages and overall
        improved gcloud performance
*   `gcloud preview app deploy` won't update local images automatically anymore.

## 0.9.75 (2015-08-26)

*   Container Engine
    *   Container Engine GA commands available under `gcloud container`.
    *   `gcloud beta container get-credentials` now takes cluster name as
        argument instead of `--cluster` flag for consistency with other
        commands.
    *   Added `gcloud alpha container clusters update <cluster>
        --cloud-monitoring=<val>` command.
*   New release notes are printed on upgrade. (This won't take effect until
    an upgrade from this version to a later version.)
*   New `gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export` command.
*   Commands promoted from `gcloud alpha` to `gcloud beta`:
    *    `gcloud beta config configurations ...`
    *    `gcloud beta sources clone`
*   Improvements in error reporting and default output formatting.


## 0.9.74 (2015-08-19)

*   New list and import commands under `gcloud alpha genomics variants`.
*   Removed `--remote` flag. Instead, please use the `--docker-build=remote`
    flag (or use `--docker-build=local` to force a local build).
*   In this release, Docker builds are hosted by default. To opt-in to the old
    behavior, please use the `--docker-build=local` flag.


## 0.9.73 (2015-08-12)

*   gcloud sql instances create default to MySQL 5.6
*   gcloud beta container get-credentials renamed to gcloud beta container
    clusters get-credentials
*   New commands
    *   gcloud beta projects ...
    *   gcloud alpha genomics callsets ...
    *   gcloud beta emulators datastore ...
    *   gcloud beta container get-server-config
    *   gcloud alpha config configurations


## 0.9.72 (2015-08-05)

*   gcloud compute
    *   initial surface changes for the backend-bucket.
    *   `instance-groups set-named-ports`: introduced a new flag
        `--named-ports NAME:PORT,[NAME:PORT,...]` - no need to specify names
        and ports in separate flags.
*   gcloud preview app deploy
    Deprecate `--remote` flag in preparation for hosted Docker builds by
    default. Instead, please use the `--docker-build={remote,local}` flag.
    The default is still a local Docker build; in two releases, the default
    will switch to a hosted build.
*   New gcloud alpha genomics operations {list, cancel, describe} commands


## 0.9.71 (2015-07-29)

*   Launching `gcloud alpha pubsub` commands.
*   Moved `gcloud preview rolling-updates` to `gcloud alpha compute
    rolling-updates`.
*   `gcloud alpha compute disks resize` command enabling resizing of persistent
    disks.
*   Beta launch of customer supplied encryption keys for Compute Engine.
*   Updated kubectl to 1.0.1.
*   `gcloud alpha container` commands now target Container Engine v1 API.
    Options for `gcloud alpha container clusters create` updated accordingly:
    *   `--user` renamed to `--username`
    *   `--cluster-api-version` removed. Cluster version is not selectable in v1
        API; new clusters always created at latest supported version.
    *   `--image` option removed. Source image not selectable in v1 API;
        clusters are always created with latest supported ContainerVM image.
        Note that using an unsupported image (i.e. not ContainerVM) would
        result in an unusable cluster in most cases anyway.
    *   Added `--no-enable-cloud-monitoring` to turn off cloud monitoring
        (on by default).
    *   Added `--disk-size` option for specifying boot disk size of node vms.
*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.24.

    For several months on the Managed VMs team we've been testing a new mode of
    `dockerless` local development on gcloud that makes developing a module for
    Python, Java and Go users similar to development of regular App Engine
    applications. This new mode relaxes the sandbox constraints present in the
    devappserver for `vm: false` applications, and does not require Docker to be
    installed.

    You can currently opt-into this behavior by setting GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=1;
    In this release of the Cloud SDK, we will be making this behavior the
    default for Managed VM users who are using gcloud.

    You can still opt-out of this behavior by setting: GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=0.

    For custom runtime users, if you are relying on the local Development Server
    to build your application, will now need to pass the `--custom-entrypoint`
    flag to `gcloud preview app run` to provide gcloud with the correct
    command to call.

    This does not affect users developing for non-managed VMs, or for users who
    are not using gcloud."
*   Bug fixes for:
    *   `gcloud preview app deploy` file paths issue on Windows.
    *   `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until-stable` periodic user
        prompting for target zone.

    does not alter the gcloud surface for users of the deployment-manager
    component.
*   Update kubectl to 1.0.0.
*   `gcloud alpha genomics` commands now use the genomics V1 API. The
    --project-number flag for `dataset create` and `dataset list` is now
