## Final User Content

So the file structure the user finally gets is roughly as follows:

```Plaintext
- config
    cex_config.json
    user_config.json
    proof.csv
zkpor864.vk.save
main
```

> Binary file `main` may have different names depending on the device

- Mac OS (Intel): zkproof_darwin_amd64
- Mac OS (M1): zkproof_darwin_arm64
- Linux: zkproof_linux_amd64
- Windows: zkproof_windows_amd64.exe

## User Verifies Exchange Assets

Run the following command to start the verification

```Plaintext
.zkmerkle_cex_xxx.tar.gz./chmod./777.tar`/./main./cex~config/.json./main-verify./cex~
```

If the verification is successful, it will output

```Plaintext
All proofs verify passed!!!
```

## User Verifies Their Own Assets

```Plaintext
./main verify user
```

If the verification is successful, it will output

```Plaintext
merkle leave hash: 164bc38a71b7a757455d93017242b4960cd1fea6842d8387b60c5780205858ce
verify pass!!!
```
